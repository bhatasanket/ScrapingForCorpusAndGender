You did one conversion, ok - but for the service you need to  - explore legal issues  - set up a work flow - \"market\" the enhanced version - offer them on a appropriate website  - ensure at least as well es possible that the service will be continued  when you are ill, unwilling or whatever ... (might be I'm overseeing parts, so pls bare with me)  So, there's much more work to do than to just prototypically show that  it's possible.     But a major goal of Free + Open Source Software is to give people more  personal freedom. So why do you think they \"should put aside biases\" -  if they just \"use\" their freedom they are offered by FLOSS philosphy.  Here, they are allowed to use whatever tool they want, so - let them  enjoy doing so.   You might be right that indeed some people behave kind of rather  fundamentalistic. But - that's their choice. If you want them to behave  differently the only thing is to argue and \"sell\" them your ideas.   And indeed, that's what you are doing, so if nobody bites into the lure,  it might be the wrong moment, not enough persuasing arguments, the wrong  people, or I don't know what else.   Try again later?   Choose a different audience?   Do it yourself? (I mean the whole thing, not just showing that it works  in principle)      Ok, so your experience predestinates you to speak in favor of offering  enhanced PDF, but still you have to persuade people here to follow your  argumentation.      Yes, I see the point that it might be an - let's say - interesting  possibility.   But speaking fo myself personnaly, I'm contributing to this project here  just because I enjoy doing things I love and decide myself to do. So I  might have catched up with your idea and helping you to propagate it.   But alas, I haven't.   For whatever reason - I just haven't.   It's not attractive enough for me to put energy into it. Not even a  small amount (as testing the enhanced PDF).   This is absolutely not meant to offend you or to discredit your opinion  or intention - in no way.   But it is just not attractive enough for me to catch fire. At least not  at the moment.  And, obviously it did not attract many other people either.   Now (if you did not receive tens of private mails speaking in favor of  your idea) I'd say, well - did not work this time, with this audience,  with these arguments - so let's try later. Or a slightly different idea.  Or with new arguments. Or what else.   But it's up to you, how you decide. That's freedom :-)  Nino definitely falling asleep in a few moments ;-)  "

Click on \"Edit Offline\" and you'll be prompted to download a working copy of the document.  Beware! You will have been whisked away from the space you were previously in, and will have been taken to a space called \"Documents I'm Editing (working copies)\". If you want to return to the space you were previously in, you can use the \"Repository\" tree structure of folders (spaces) on the left-hand side and get back there in probably one click.  To \"check in\" the working copy you've edited, you would return to the document's space (or your \"Documents I'm Editing\" space), hover your mouse over the document, and click on \"Upload New Version\".

This is an awesome rate of exchange of mail correspondence on a dev list.  If there is a known bug, the devs have a quick response to their fixes. Feeding the LibreOffice bugzilla is the best way to quash those bugs.  And, thanks to the devs for their amazing work!  Cheers  Marc    "

        "text": "ReHi Tom and Danishka:  (Tom: Please see personal message below).  For all:  Being a long time techie who first got his nose into technology about half a century back, I love the open source approach. I think it is more socially fair to all, and that I see as globally essential.  When Oracle bought out Sun Microsystems, many of us knew that Open office would slowly become \"less open\", and it seems to me that a number of Oo users, (I remember one German engineer amongst others) wisely decided we needed a suite that was totally and irrevocably dedicated to being non-profit and open source.  At the time, I was able to use this on my Windows XP based platforms, but not on the Fedora ones.  Since then, I have upgraded the hard drive on the laptop I rebuilt when someone had walked on it and broken the screen. Instead of the original 160 Gb. hard drive, it now uses a Seagate Momentus 500 Gb. Hybrid SSD/conventional Hard drive. I Find that Seagate's interface technology for dynamically optimizing the use of the 2 storage areas and rendering the whole to the system as one hard drive works very well in Fedora. Fedora 13 loaded a fresh install like wildfire.  Shortly thereafter, I got an automatic upgrade that ended up installing Fedora 15, i386 on the machine, and that runs as well as any, although I found I needed to add Docker to it for legibility of the preferred icons.  Fedora 15 came with LibreOffice - hooray!  I imagine when I upgrade the other Linux installation to F15 x-86_64, it will also come with Libre Office.  That machine dual boots Win XP and Linux and can handle a third platform if needed, all BIOS controlled. It has 4 physical SATA hard drives. One, a 160 Gb. is currently failing, and in a week or so will be replaced with an SSD.  The purpose of this is for the swap files, so it is partitioned with 3 primary partitions, one a Linux Swap partition of about 12 Gb. (Lots of space here), and an extended partition.  The 2 other primary partitions are used to divert the Windows pagefile.sys (read swap file) so that Windows does not have to wait for the boot drive to seek in order to swap.  This, like Seagate's Momentus drives, should speed up the system for all the platforms considerably.  The third primary partition,. and the remaining space, can be used for swap files associated with specific applications, especially those which are processor intensive, such as Photoshop, Gimp, VideoLan, Cinelerra, etc.  I have yet to investigate whether Libre Office can use this kind of dedicated swap space or not, especially as I use Libre Office Draw extensively, and some of the drawings are quite data-large.  Hopefully this little message will generate some added excitement for readers about what one can do on a fairly frugal budget when one wants to enough.  =====================================  _*Tom:*_  Knowing you are in the U.K., and myself living in Greater Montreal, Canada, I get a chuckle at your comment of \"English or American\".  We all know that for any language that is spoken in multiple countries (What better example than English?), the computing world has to treat each dialect as a completely separate language.  Personally I speak Canadian English first, Multinational French second, and some Spanish third, and have given speeches in all 3, although much more limited in Spanish.  In Montreal, there is no majority. One can reasonably expect there to be 80 languages in a day. This being such a tower of Babel, I don't have to spend money getting on an airplane, the whole world is on my doorstep! to me this is great, Je les apprivoiserai tous!  The same in the U.S. there are about 10 Americans for every Canadian, and there's lots of variety.  Personally, I expect to treat each person anywhere for what they are and for what their culture has made them, and have fun doing so! so in the U.S. I absorb as much of the > or manners of speaking as I can, and can make others happy because I do.  I also can use snippets from non-English languages with a unilingual English audience, expecting them only to get a clue from the sound of it (\"vocal variety\" as Toastmasters would call it.)  \"Blimey!\" (smile and chuckle!

I had also noticed your very capable contributions along the way (kudos) and surmised when I saw you had gone towards LibreOffice that likely you and enough more were anxious about the danger of Open Office becoming \"less open\" on a gradual basis after Oracle had bought out Sun Microsystems. I also had the same concern, and am glad to see that LibreOffice is an \".ORG\" and does not expect to ever become profit-making.  I think in the current state of world affairs, this needs to be.  When I saw what was happening with the inception of LibreOffice, I went that way on my windows platforms. At the time I was not able to get it to run on either of the Fedora installations, however since, partly due to a hardware upgrade on the laptop, Fedora automatically offered me an upgrade that ended up installing Fedora 15 i386. This came with LibreOffice by default so I was happy.  Prior to that, that machine would not even accept F14. The upgrade was the hard drive. The original one was a 160 Gb. traditional 2 1/2\" hard drive. The upgrade was one of Seagate's Momentus series of hybrid SSD/traditional drives - the largest of that series (500Gb.)  Installation of F15 just flew! The Interface Seagate has used on this drive optimizes the use of the 2 storage areas and makes the package look to the system as one single hard drive.

Prego, (just watched Stealing Beauty and missing Tuscany).   Alas, the RSS feed does not do full posts.  Can you change that?  There are folks like myself who won't subscribe to teaser-RSS feeds: It makes us work too hard.  Other folks don't want full posts.  You might need to offer different buttons for people to choose their preferred feed.  (I don't know how easy it is to get WordPress to do those things.)    In the two months, there have been 9 posts and two comments.  You've got more categories than posts so far!  Although I am a very negligent blog poster, I think that not posting more frequently is a problem if you want more attention.  I don't know who the posters are, I see the generic Team poster and 3 named contributors, all with one apiece except for Jean.  There are no links to author profiles from the post timestamps.  That makes the blog too one-way.  But maybe you want to figure out what people would be looking for that you have to offer, beside announcements.  I'm guessing.  And what relationship are you out to establish.  Blogs are conversational.  Not fragments of user manuals.  The voice is different.  I have seen books written on a blog, but this isn't that.  For example, explain the way that the styles dialogs work and what the categories are, in small short articles in a series.  And screen shots, lots of screen shots.  Or just point out where the Page Layout option is and what is there, what can be controlled.  I have a question already - can I have a different layout for each sheet of a spreadsheet document, and can each sheet have different headers and footers.  The Page Preview is scary, having me think that I am stuck with the one, so I don't want to try making headers over different pages and find out that is not what I got.  There is no document preview print preview that I can find, only single page preview.  How do I preview the document?   Stuff like that. And more human presence.  What do you struggle with using it yourself and figuring out how to document it.  What is your most memorable duhh... moment.  I suspect writers may be reluctant bloggers, having to do with how precious the words are regarded, perhaps.  Yet some of the greatest blogs I read are by authors and screen writers.  But they talk about their experience, they don't put their writing on the blog unless there is some story they have to tell about something in their work or struggling or dealing with the publishing process, movie studios, publishers and having to do book tours, etc.  What's your drama around documenting LibreOffice?  Also, because this is where your audience is, things that folks stumble on when it isn't like Word or Excel or PowerPoint, and how to learn around in Libre Office instead.  Basta!

Notwithstanding, a lot of posts that plague blogging, and are more in the line of \"negative rants\" have made blogging in general more difficult to moderate and manage.  Still more \"notwithstanding\",  and recalling an apt point I remember reading in the July 1995 issue of CGA magazine, in an article about 5 types of difficult personalities in the office, where they were referring to the habitual complainer type, their point was that these individuals are more interested in voicing complaints than providing any aid to their solutions.  To me this correlates closely with the problem I mentioned above regarding the moderation of guest blogging.  Worse still, we so often see that the objects of so many problems and complaints are 2-sided wrongs or multi-sided equivalents, where nobody really wants to compromise adequately, nor even be open about that very fact.  If, being aware of that very concern, a person chooses to \"complain for the sake of complaining\" because they see no hope of resolution, that level, detrimental as it is, is also comprehensible.  All of this is so well known to many cultures, especially those which have been around much longer than that of North America, however this is where I see a major case of \"explicitness is of the essence\".  English is the most associative language I have heard of, however, especially in North America, it seriously lacks the vocabulary and practice to handle interpersonal and emotional difficulties well. English has its strength in the technical and scientific arenas because of its associativeness, but therein its \"Ying and Yang\", so little be it often understood here.  As a person who loves his languages, with English as a forst language, followed by French and Spanish as second and third, I see the mission to render the emotive capacities of romance languages into the pragmatic explicitness of English to take these skills out of the darkness of \"a black magic skill\" in which they have languished so long to the detriment of the better common good.

The differences between the more OpenSource  platforms and the Windows one are not huge.  The screen-shots can only give  people an approximate idea of where to look since there is a high chance of them  using different themes and screen resolutions.     I think having a more relaxed approach and \"showing off\" how customisable  LibreOffice is could be more important than branding and being consistent in  everything but a lot of people are arguing for a more unified, consistent  approach (which also makes sense to me).

        "text": "Now that we are getting close to having a full set of rebranded user guides for LibreOffice (based on the OOo guides), I would like to put forward for discussion some major changes to the Getting Started guide. (I have made the same proposal to the OOo group, but the two guides do not need to remain in parallel if the two groups choose different paths to improve them.)   The Getting Started guide was originally intended to be no longer than 200 pages, but it is now closer to 400 pages. I would like to cut out some chapters and make them into standalone guides, drop some material that is covered in other books and IMO is no longer needed in this one, slightly reorganise what's left, and add some pointers to the other books and documents. Details below. The main goal is to improve the book's usefulness for new users; decreasing the page count is a secondary goal.  1) Remove Chapter 8 (Getting Started with Base) and make it a standalone document. It is 52 pages long (longer than the Math Guide) and I think would be more useful to beginning Base users if it's standalone. Also, I think the vast majority of new OOo users will NOT be using Base.  2) Remove Chapter 9 (Getting Started with Math) because it duplicates the first part of the Math Guide and is therefore not needed here.  3) Remove most of Chapter 12 (Creating Web Pages) because the info is given in the guides for Writer, Impress, etc and is really little more than an export function; it could be mentioned briefly in the chapter on Printing, Exporting etc. Info on hyperlinks needs to be put somewhere else; I don't have a specific suggestion on this, but it didn't really fit in this chapter anyway, since it's relevant to more than web page creation.  4) Combine Chapter 2 (Setting up OOo) and Chapter 14 (Customizing) and leave the result at the end of the book. This is similar to the way the topics are handled in the other books.  5) Drop Appendix A (Keyboard Shortcuts) and put a brief mention in Chapter 1 with a pointer to the Help.  That's the major changes. I have a few other changes to suggest in various chapters. In total the reorganisation should cut the page count down below 300 pages and make the book more useful for the majority of new users.   Comments?  --Jean   "

Then just delete some  sections, swap covers and maybe screen-shots to re-release for OOo.     Judging from recent questions in the Users List a macro's guide would be very  much appreciated soon.

With macros there are likely to be issues that are fairly unique to each app.   Some things that people are likely to want to do in Calc are (hopefully) much  less relevant to Writer.  How brief to keep that sort of thing is a tough  choice.  Perhaps the introductory few paragraphs could be fairly similar in all  guides?  With Base documentation it might be great to copy that to the specifically Base  area and then cut the stuff that is in the Getting Started Guide?  As for email clients then i think we might need a disclaimer saying that they  are separate projects and then try to avoid corporate scenarios where they have  an MS Exchange Server.  Perhaps just cover the simplest scenarios.     I think i am just re-stating what other people have said but it makes sense to  me and sounds like a good direction imo.

From just the references I know of :  English language books : editors I have seen range from Lulu (individual authoring), Sam's, the \"for Dummies\" series, probably a few others of which I've not heard.  French language : a plethora of small publishing houses by different authors, mostly OOo/LibO module-centric, e.g. Eyrolles is perhaps the most well-known publisher. They also produce the excellent book on Macro programming by Laurent Godard and Bernard Marcelly (in French only alas).   German language : books by Thomas Krumbein, covering each module of the suite. There are others I have seen on my travels to Germany.  In my experience, it is fairly rare to see one editor publish in multiple languages, the exception possibly being the \"for Dummies\" book.  I am at a loss to understand why this might be, after all, there are a fair number of talented technical translators out there, but I suppose that translation costs inevitably eat into editors' margins.

The \"Getting Started Guide\" would be a great addition to any Library collection for student referral/reference.  In my experience, there is still a small segment of the student population that do read manuals and they usually pass on their knowledge to others in their class.  I have thus far taught for 18 years as Math, Science and Technology consultant (primary and secondary schools); classroom teacher; computer classroom specialist and French Second Language specialist at various times during these years. I am presently off on disability for crushed spine and complications but hope to get back to class soon.  Cheers  Marc  "

Gary   Hi :) I agree up to a point.  Many people are sociable up to a point and often find it  easier to ask other people than look things up.  I can think of a few exceptions  tho!  People with even mild aspergers or other issues might tend to shy away  from people prefer books and computers.  Various forms of arrogance or honour or  pride.  Fear of being seen as weak.  Shame.  Fear of being indebted to anyone.   In many countries it goes against the culture and is considered rude to ask for  help.  Some people just love books.     Sociable people are generally the people we notice most often.  People that are  good at hiding away  are less easy to notice.    Regards from Tom :)  "

If you have a good suggestion for a  user-name there then please tell the list asap otherwise they might just go with  something obvious.     Afaik the idea is to download a guide and sign it out to let people know you are  working on it.  Then edit off-line, change version number (?) and re-upload to  the relevant section of Alfresco.  There have been various good instructions  posted to this list but i have lost the best one.  I did find this follow-up  from David   When you're using the Alfresco Share interface (at  http://documentation.libreoffice.org therefore), you go to the space containing the document you want to \"check out\" (edit offline). Hover your mouse  over the document and you will see a menu appear to the right of the document  name. Click on the \"More...\" item and a further menu opens. Click on \"Edit  Offline\" and you'll be prompted to downloada working copy of the document.  Beware! You will have been whisked away from the space you were previously in,  and will have been taken to a space called \"Documents I'm Editing (working  copies)\". If you want to return to the space you were previously in, you can use  the \"Repository\" tree structure of folders (spaces) on the left-hand side and  get back there in probablyone click.  To \"check in\" the working copy you've edited, you would return to the document's  space (or your \"Documents I'm Editing\" space), hover yourmouse over the  document, and click on \"Upload New Version\".  We'll get this properly documented very, very soon.   The guides that need working on at the moment are Draw, Impress, Math although  people are working on parts of those (i think) so co-ordinating with them  through the sign-in/out sheet in Alfresco would be good.  The documentation for  Base is really bad, practically non-existent although a couple of people have  managed to pull a few things off the website.  Hopefully they are stored in  Alfresco ready to pull together.  Base is a bit awkward as there seems to be  regressions and quirkiness that is completely different between 1 release and  another.

It's obvious to me that for most people getting started with databases is very significantly more difficult than getting started with any other module of a typical office suite.

This serves as advertisement, and inducement to dig into the module further. That this may need to be done using separate documentation should be no impediment (unless, of course, it doesn't exist, which appears to be the case with Base, at present).  I can think of several ways to ease people into using a database, such that significant incremental learning can begin for them.

I saw many times in the field that there are usually key people who serve as conduits between formal knowledge repositories (libraries, book, technical consultants, etc.) and people who need answers. We call these people \"culture brokers\", and they are pivotal people in any major culture change process.  I suggest that technical manuals are not ever for the average person, or for the majority of users, but rather for the person who by training and/or inclination is at least somewhat of a scholar - i.e., they value textural repositories of information. They acquire this information, then pass it on to others. I see this happen all the time in forums and discussion lists devoted to various computer programs.  This is not a problem, but just a fact of how people work. When we compile succinct, accessible sources of problem solutions and basic information we are feeding the culture brokers. We must be at peace with the fact that it is they who take the information to the front-line user, in most cases. Over time, increasing numbers of people do consult primary information sources, but I expect that the majority will always consult other people first, if only because it is usually a quicker path to a solution.

This means that the publisher may not have even covered costs and although a German version was created, it was not released (because the publisher expected that they would not cover printing costs and similar). This is also why a new edition was not released even though I created it.  I had people tell me that they would never pay for a book on free software. One guy even emailed me and said \"I don't want to pay for your book, can you just send me a copy\". He emailed back later and said \"never mind, I was able to find a pirated copy\".  The incentive to spend time and money on the project with such blatant issues is pretty low.  So, I expect that the reason that the book is not highly translated is because people are not making much (if any) money on a particular topic, so everything is done by people that spending hundreds or thousands of hours because they enjoy it. Sure, a bunch of people profit from it (knowledge wise), but although it takes time away from my family, it does not pay the bills.

I also have quite a few LibO Draw screenshots from Linux that can be dropped in to replace the ones that need replacement. Those use the silver theme that I've been using. Most of the pix in the other chapters of the OOo Draw Guide don't show anything OOo (unlike in this chapter), and almost all of the pix were taken on Linux, so they should be okay as a first cut.  My view is: do this book quickly and then when the design &amp; docs teams have sorted out what theme is \"official\" someone can replace all the screenshots then. Otherwise production of this book, and the Impress Guide, will drag on far too long.  I have just replaced Chapters 2 through 7 in the Draw Guide Drafts folder with ones that have been further edited and updated for OOo. Martin Fox, who did the updating, says he checked it in both OOo and LibO. So if you continue with the rebranding, be sure to get the latest copy.  Also, we've got to sort out something so the files show as \"checked out\" by you, or I may end up duplicating work you're doing.

So while there are some information around, this is currently not satisfying for the people who need to know most of the new features. This is not only documentation writers - these are also localizers, quality assurance, people giving user support etc.  This was one of the reasons why I tried how a small specification can be put to the wiki. Once more people use this approach,we could just add categories (like NewIn3.5) and would have a good list.  But (i wrote this already at the design and at the German lists): although I personally think, that a (basic and not over-formalized) specification is welcome to most of the developers, hardly any developer will write a detailed specification on his own. This is not because developers are lazy - it is just that ~1/4th of the specification can be written by non-developers. E.g.  - you do not need a developer to find the correct place for a new option,  - you do not need a developer to know what the new label should read,  - you do not need a developer to search in the OOo usage-tracking data and identify how often a (supposed to be removed) UI item has been used.  - you do not need a developer to identify side-effects for the user's workflow  - you do not need a developer to write the help   Some of these tasks even *should* not be done by developers, because they (naturally) think more in terms of code (e.g. a developer's decision where to put a new UI element might be heavily influnced by the internal code structures - what is in many cases not the best for the end user, not knowing the implementation). But the developer needs to be involved, as she needs to give input about what works and what not (and developers have ego's, so even their opinion about user interaction should be considered ;) ).  To give you an impression about the work that a non-developer could do: I worked about 2 days on the spec (discussion at mailinglists, do some mockups / prototyping, search for usage data, document what I found...). The implementation was done in one and a half day - and it took only that long, because I never ever did contribute new functionality to LibreOffice before - during this one and a half day I learned how to implement new UI elements and store options. I even did almost three full implementations (the not used alternatives had been implemented for learning purposes). After all - the real code-related work was less than 1/3rd of all the work.   We need to come to a point, where non-developers help with all these things and collaborate with developers (code hackers). For this, we need to make people aware (what I did was just a test of what people are already aware).   regards,  Andr   "

This makes things line up correctly (especially with long chapter titles that wrap around) as well as making everything come out correctly when the chapters are compiled into a book.  This chapter needs to have the Mac keystrokes info on the copyright page. I think all the other chapters now have it.  I'm not sure how you're doing the changes to the notes &amp; tips tables, but it's causing extra blank paragraphs to be inserted. I have set up an AutoFormat for each of the table types and apply the appropriate one to the table, so the spacing doesn't change. Unfortunately, AutoFormats, like AutoText, don't get saved in the template.  Tables of data have a slightly different appearance too. Again, I've set this up as an AutoFormat, so it's easy to apply to an existing table.  Copyright page acknowledgements are unusually wordy in this book, and quite a long list, so I suggest a slightly different approach from the other books, as follows. Only the last line will change from what is now in each of the chapters.  This chapter is based on an original French document written for OpenOffice.org 1.x by Michel Pinquier (translated into English by Alex Thurgood) and previous content revised by Jim Taylor. The chapter was revised for OpenOffice.org 2.0 by Linda Worthington, Daniel Carrera, Jean Hollis Weber, and Agnes Belzunce, and later translated into German by Wolfgang Uhlig. The German revisions were then translated into English and revised for OpenOffice.org 3.3 and LibreOffice 3.3 by Martin Fox.

Yes - this is what it is meant do be finally.   This is not at all \"minor value work\". There is of course the problem that people tend to think that their own contribution is what really matters - for developers this might not only be a tendency ;) But this is really tricky, beause if no non-developers contribute to new feature implementation, you will very likely get a bad designed feature. If no developers contribute to new feature implementation you will get no feature at all.  So just convince developers to implement \"real good features or the users\" instead of \"implement cool features because we can\". This can be done best if you make them aware that also non-developers *do* contribute a lot and ease developer's job.

The discussions about this in other lists could take forever and we need  documentation out there.  The theme arrived at in the Documentation Team really  does seem to be the clearest and best for documentation.  It might not be the  best for screen-shots for websites or other places but is the best for  documentation.  If other teams ask the Documentation Team to use something that  is not so good for documentation then we can try to deal with that then.  One  way that springs to mind is to tell them \"to get stuffed\" but i'm sure we can  find a more diplomatic way of saying that ;)     Regards from Tom :)      ________________________________ From: Jean Hollis Weber  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] Draw Guide    OK, will do. A quick look shows a few things that you probably wouldn't have known about, which I can fix quickly. (I'll list them for you after I've gone through the chapter more carefully.) Also, I have a few minor editorial changes that came out of working this week on the OOo Draw Guide, so I'll make them too.  I also have quite a few LibO Draw screenshots from Linux that can be dropped in to replace the ones that need replacement. Those use the silver theme that I've been using. Most of the pix in the other chapters of the OOo Draw Guide don't show anything OOo (unlike in this chapter), and almost all of the pix were taken on Linux, so they should be okay as a first cut.  My view is: do this book quickly and then when the design &amp; docs teams have sorted out what theme is \"official\" someone can replace all the screenshots then. Otherwise production of this book, and the Impress Guide, will drag on far too long.  I have just replaced Chapters 2 through 7 in the Draw Guide Drafts folder with ones that have been further edited and updated for OOo. Martin Fox, who did the updating, says he checked it in both OOo and LibO. So if you continue with the rebranding, be sure to get the latest copy.  Also, we've got to sort out something so the files show as \"checked out\" by you, or I may end up duplicating work you're doing. For example, I had just checked out Chapters 1, 2, and 3, having forgotten that you were working on Chapter 1. Just as well I then took a break and came back to find your note.  Jean "

The problem with asking for help is that while the question might seem obvious  to the person asking there might be a large number of variables that they might  be unaware of.  Usually someone in the answering team will ask questions to find  out precisely what is being asked.  Hopefully they might be able to take a guess  at an answer in the same email.     At work one of my colleagues said his \"computer was totally f@*$%^d\".  He asked  me for help but wouldn't let me see or handle the machine and wouldn't answer  any of my questions about it.  This went on for about 2 days.  When i finally  managed to get him to answer about 3 simple questions i was able to fix it in 3  mouse-clicks taking about 1minute.  The next time he told me his machine was  completely dead he answered my 1st question a lot faster so instead of being  down for 2 days he was back almost seemlessly.  The 3rd time he just wanted me  to watch while he fixed it himself.  After that people stopped bothering to set  his Windows to open with a single-click rather than a double-click.     Much the same seemed to happen here.  Quite a few people asked Andre  specifically what the text was that he wanted proof-reading and where that text  appears but all he did was keep repeating the links to the wiki-page that all  looked perfect.  As soon as we found out what text needed editing it was easy to  help.     The failure to help was not to do with the system nor the software used.

MS could consider LO as a direct competitor to MSO and thus would look for our legal blunders committed out of ignorance of US law.    It may be more tedious for us to make sure our screenshots do not show anything that would imply a Windows OS but it is safer. I doubt any Linux distro would be upset if their desktop was identifiable in one of our screenshots. In fact a subtle plug could made by saying all the screenshots were made on various Linux distros.

Also, certainly in Europe, Microsoft would be likely to attract loud criticism and incite hostile activism in doing so.  But, even if one were to avoid Windows screenshots to the greatest extent possible (it being difficult to produce good Windows installation guides - for example - without taking screenshots under Windows), I still would not like to see the English docs team and website team taking its screenshots purely under Linux/Unix. What about the Macintosh platform? I'd certainly like to encourage more involvement from Mac users.  Also, in response to a conversation taking place currently on the Design mailing list (the which list I'm CC'ing), it's my personal feeling that it is not especially beneficial to ensure that all screenshots look identical (in terms of the theme used). Nor do I personally feel it's particularly beneficial to ensure that all screenshots be taken using a theme based on colors from the LibreOffice Design/Marketing pallet.  An English documentation contributor's guide has been developed with rational recommendations for the taking of screenshots, and I think it largely addresses the issues that really matter in terms of their usability/suitability.  However, I feel that we should make it as easy as possible for new English docs and website contributors to get involved, and not set-up unnecessary requirements in terms of software used and GUI environment. And I also feel we should *celebrate* the possible diversity of OS and GUI for running LibreOffice, and need not shun variety of colors and themes in screenshots either for English LibreOffice documentation or for LibreOffice websites.  Anyway, this is just to make clear my own POV on the subject one final time. Thanks for reading, if you did.  "

However they do put a LOT of work into creating a very  distinctive style so it's possible they are worse than MS are reputed to be.     Gnu&amp;Linux distros are likely to be more sensible and see it as free  advertising.     I think we should aim at being consistent for now for new screen-shots, because  we have excellent people such as Jaimon that are able to focus on doing  screen-shots for people that haven't got the agreed themes.  This means some  people can focus on the words without having to worry about side-issues.     After the Design Team arrive at a conclusion and after Jean gets back i think  that would be a better time to discuss screen-shots in future releases of  documentation.     Haphazard and ill-considered differences will detract from our documentation and  there is no need for it when we have a good system for producing higher quality  results.  Jaimon &amp; Jean have put a lot of work into this.  Please, lets not  spoil it for them now!  At the moment the screen-shots seem more on a level that competes with Apple's   aim of high quality artistic simplicity &amp; skill.  Regards from Tom :)    ________________________________ From: David Nelson  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org; design@global.libreoffice.org Subject: [libreoffice-documentation] Screenshots for LibreOffice documentation  Hi Jay, *,   Well, if one *were* to accept that the risk might possibly exist in the US, I somehow *feel* that Microsoft would be much less likely to succeed in such hypothetical action in European courts. Also, certainly in Europe, Microsoft would be likely to attract loud criticism and incite hostile activism in doing so.  But, even if one were to avoid Windows screenshots to the greatest extent possible (it being difficult to produce good Windows installation guides - for example - without taking screenshots under Windows), I still would not like to see the English docs team and website team taking its screenshots purely under Linux/Unix. What about the Macintosh platform? I'd certainly like to encourage more involvement from Mac users.  Also, in response to a conversation taking place currently on the Design mailing list (the which list I'm CC'ing), it's my personal feeling that it is not especially beneficial to ensure that all screenshots look identical (in terms of the theme used). Nor do I personally feel it's particularly beneficial to ensure that all screenshots be taken using a theme based on colors from the LibreOffice Design/Marketing pallet.  An English documentation contributor's guide has been developed with rational recommendations for the taking of screenshots, and I think it largely addresses the issues that really matter in terms of their usability/suitability.  However, I feel that we should make it as easy as possible for new English docs and website contributors to get involved, and not set-up unnecessary requirements in terms of software used and GUI environment. And I also feel we should *celebrate* the possible diversity of OS and GUI for running LibreOffice, and need not shun variety of colors and themes in screenshots either for English LibreOffice documentation or for LibreOffice websites.  Anyway, this is just to make clear my own POV on the subject one final time. Thanks for reading, if you did.  "

The trick is to find something that hasn't been checked out by someone else.

        "text": "Hi,    The relevant legal issue is the that the copyright is valid and will be valid for many more years on Windows design elements. Under US copyright law the minimum length of a valid copyright is something like 70 years, so the XP copyrights will be valid for about another 60 years or so. The are two safe ways to avoid being sued: get permission from the copyright owner or do not infringe at all. The permission should be in writing, signed by authorized owner representative. To my knowledge the TDF does not have permission from Microsoft for use in of MS elements in a screenshot.  The only way the copyright can expire before its statuary term is for the owner to put the work (as it is called) into the public domain. Alternatively they can issue the work under a creative commons or \"copyleft\" type grant allowing users to use the work freely with possible stipulations about attribution. To my knowledge MS has not done either for the Windows design elements.  To gave an example, as an amateur photographer I own the copyright to all my photos from the moment of creation under US copyright law. Unless I grant you permission to use any of my photos I have the legal right to sue for damages and will probably win. I can give different people/groups different permissions for the some the work.   If something is a trademark, the trademark holder must show that they will defend their trademark. Translation, they must sue trademark infringers aggressively or risk losing the trademark and any related brand value from it. This is different from copyright where the owner is not obligated to aggressively protect the copyright from infringement. I do not know what is specifically a trademark on the Windows GUI nor do I want find out by being sued. Coca-Cola is very aggressive about protecting their trademark \"Coke\" from infringement. If you call a cola you server in your cafe Coke, it had better be Coke and not Pepsi or some other cola. Coca-Cola is known to sue over this.  The fact that others may use something without getting permission does not mean that we should also. It is not a valid defense in court.  I suspect that most publishers know enough to get the appropriate permissions prior to publishing and releasing a work. It is possible they could a blanket agreement allowing certain uses for any work published during the agreement term.  "

Of course, one should request permission from any such copyright holders for that purpose.

If this peripheral area was of any real concern to Microsoft, they surely would have responded by now in a material manner to this during the past two-plus decades that their Windows products were employed as GUIs.

To use a selection list, select a blank cell and press Ctrl+D. A drop-down list appears of any cell in the same column that either has at least one text character or whose format is defined as Text. Click on the entry you require.    With Version 3.3.3, the key combination is Ctrl+Shift+D for the mentioned selection list.

Alfresco Share is exposing at http://documentation.libreoffice.org, and is the newer interface on which the Alfresco project is focusing its development work.  Exposing only one of the two interfaces would simplify the work of development and documentation of workflows, and would decrease the exposure to potential hacking.  a) Does anyone have a particular preference for one or other interface?

I've rolled back the server reconfiguration I did, and now Alfresco Explorer is again available at http://alfresco.libreoffice.org while Alfresco Share is available at http://documentation.libreoffice.org.  The problem seems to be with accented characters in the folder (\"space\") names, although actual files in folders can contain accented characters in text. It's obviously a major disadvantage for NL projects (although this problem does not exist with Alfresco Explorer at http://alfresco.libreoffice.org).  I renamed a couple of the folders (\"spaces\") minus the accents. Feel free to correct the spellings and put the accents back.  I'll be taking this up with the Alfresco project ASAP to find a solution, although there is now a new version of Alfresco out (we're running 3.4c and 3.4d has been released). So I'll envision doing an upgrade very soon. Simply doing that might fix things.  I'll report back on the issue as soon as possible.  In any case, in the meantime, all NL content can be accessed and worked on via Alfresco Explorer (http://alfresco.libreoffice.org).  Guys, thanks for making me aware of the problem, and please do let me know if you run into any others or if you have any questions.  "

My inclination would be to go ahead with the upgrade, but I wanted to ask for your opinions first.  If there were no comments or if the consensus was to upgrade, I'd probably work on it at sometime over the next week, after properly backing-up our content and preparing for a rollback if needed.  Similarly, I'd be inclined to retire the Explorer interface and just keep the Share interface, because this would make it simpler to learn and document how to use Alfresco.  Any thoughts about this?

This volume would contain Chapters 13 through 16 of the current book, plus the bibliographies section of Chapter 12 (and possibly the indexes section of Ch12), new information on linking or embedding spreadsheets, audio, and video in Writer documents, info on macros (especially recording), possibly info on xforms. May be other topics to include, such as Writer/Web.  Depending on the reactions to this proposal, I will post a draft set of tables of contents.  I will also soon put all of this on the wiki, if I haven't done so already. (I keep thinking I put the Getting Starting Toc on the wiki, but I can't find it.)  --Jean   "

Perhaps after reading your proposals in greater detail on the wiki, I'd see better what the advantages would be.  But one other point I'd raise is that maybe it would be more profitable to fill one of the existing documentation holes rather than revamping material we already have and that does the job as is?

There are at  least 2 people that joined Documentation specifically to work on it rather than  on other guides.  The problem seems to be that Base is a bit quirky and keeps  suffering odd regressions.  What works and what doesn't is very unpredictable in  each release and even what 'should' work is not always clear.     We need to attract devs to work on Base.  At the moment there are none  apparently.  Perhaps now that IBM contributed all that code to Apache the  OpenOffice Base might take a large step forwards but again that makes LO's Base  difficult to write for unless we can get that code base into LO too.

I  don't see the advantage in splitting those large guides into smaller chunks  until the guides reach the size of MS Office's vast tomes.

Many things that used to work in OOo 3.2.x, and for which the pre-existing OOo Base documentation was written, now either no longer work at all, or only partially.  Paradoxically, the built-in help was actually much more detailed in OOo before the switch to HC2/wiki-help, and since then it has been quite simply unhelpful. Try carrying out a meaningful search in the Base help and you will soon find out why, it is enough to drive anyone nuts.  Add to that the new features that were added to OOo during 3.x codebase development, many of which were either not fully functional (charts in reports), buggy (SQL parser engine), or quite simply got screwed up when the LibreOffice project took over (see current Base bug list), and you have a documenter's nightmare in the making. The bug fixes to Base that the OOo developers had in their child workspaces whilst Oracle was pulling the plug on OOo have not been integrated into the LibreOffice code because there is a lack of clarity as to whether these are indeed freely available (since by their very nature, they were CWSes by Oracle employees, not trunk code, and thus not yet approved for submission into the main source tree).    The devs would not only need to work on Base to patch it up, but also provide documentation for the functions that get developed / completed / corrected.  As for the Apache project, I can't see it being able to produce anything of that ilk in any short timeframe, as the people there are still trying to work out which bits of code they are actually allowed to integrate into their source tree. They are still faced with many licensing issues about various parts of their project, including how, or whether to, host the documentation that has accrued over the years within the OOo project, because a lot of it is under an Apache-incompatible licence. Things might get sorted out, but it will be later, rather than sooner.  To put it bluntly, Base is currently in some kind of interdimensional space where it is being left to degenerate as other parts of the code progress.   Alex   "

I prefer to get one large PDF containing all the info and being easily navigable with links in the TOC and cross-references in the text, where appropriate. I don't particularly want to download and open several docs when researching the same subject.  My perception of the book buyer market is that they'd be likely to be tempted either by very advanced reference works containing material that might not get into the normal user's guide.  Alternatively, they'd perhaps be up for things like printed memory joggers and \"quick reference material\" to have at hand or on a wall nearby. You can probably image the kind of material I'm thinking of - the kind of stuff it's really most convenient to have on paper rather than on-screen.  Or perhaps tackle the real beginners market with kind-of \"Dummy's Guide\" type books or text books suitable for children and students?  But, for me at least, it would fall into a niche apart from our standard documentation such as we're working up at the moment.  Anyway, those were just a few additional reflections...   Well, I'm not sure that's necessarily entirely true... as I said above, perhaps it's more a question of identifying user bases who prefer to work with printed material, and material that is more meaningful, practical and useful when it's on paper, on your wall, etc...

As regards macros, maybe in the Writer guide we could focus on *recording macros* primarily (even though in my Ubuntu's 3.3.2 it's still counted as an experimental feature) because, as I remember from recent threads, there was an idea that macros could usefully be covered in a dedicated guide. Perhaps that could be written into a guide that would also incorporate the BASIC programming guide awaiting branding.  More things to add to our growing to-do list...  "

Preferably paid devs because  there is a bit of a quagmire trying to work out which patches have which  licences and so which cannot be incorporated into the LGPL and which can.  It  needs people that work like devs but also people that like to research like  documenters.  Could we get Wikipedia, Google, RedHat, Cannonical and others to  stump up some cash for this?  Could TDF itself afford to pay for it?  I think we  need a couple of full-time paid researchers and a paid dev to start things  moving.

My MySQL database \"serves\" a windband and all the issues related to such an animal (eg. repertoire, uniforms, members, contacts, concert programmes, etc., etc.). Of course my tables are small compared to what I used to see when working with DB2 at large IBM-customers. \"Big\" tables might have some 30.000 tuples in them, so just looking for a particular item using a filter such as \"like name*\" never takes long. On the other hand, I have been complaining about problems using the report writer for serial letters. Conditions based on variables in a table are not handled correctly in the Linux 3.3.3 version (they seem th work under Windows!!). I REALLY depend on BASE not falling behind or on its face altogether. So I also think that some emphasis should be place on it. Unfortunately I neither have the knowledge nor the time to devote myself to such an effort... Regards from Austria H. Stoellinger      "

Jean   Hi :) I had forgotten that we had already discussed all that.  I had not read the  macro chapters until after reading Jean's post.  The one in the GS Guide looks  excellent and very generic.  If it is easy to have that in all the guides then i  think it makes the books sold by Lulu more complete.     The Calc Guides' chapter on Macros demands that people read the one in the GS  Guide first.  I think it would be better to include the GS chapter in the Calc  Guide being sold at Lulu now that we have a neat way of doing that without  risking  fragmentation.     Macros are possibly more heavily used in Calc than in any other of the apps  (apart from Base, possibly) so having 2 chapters there for it makes sense.  With  the other 4 apps it would be nice to include the same chapter that is in the GS  \"just in case\".  I don't think they need anything more than that.     Just my first thoughts tho,  I'm fairly sure most people have thought about it a  lot more than me.    Regards from Tom :)  "

(In the OOo Wiki Clayton had installed an extension allowing to watch a  whole category of pages. Maybe this could ease life in TDF wiki, too, as   only one page would have to be watched.

        "text": "Hi :) At the moment i don't think details such as that really matter.  It's more  important to focus on just getting through the guides quickly and getting the  first releases \"out there\" asap.  Later on, in the next releases, it might be  good to agree on details and get things more consistent.  At the moment we just  need the first releases \"out there\" fast.      I mostly work in forums,  mailing lists and direct contact trying to help people  by pointing them to the right pages (or chapters) in documentation so \"my take\"  might be very different.     I tend to favour \"Camel Case\" for words that are joined together, eg  QuickStarter, LibreOffice and i also do that with widely used acronyms such as  Ram, Cpu, Gnu, Wine, LxDE to avoid  suddenly shouting out a word that is  becoming quite common place.     If i have to spell out what the acronym stands for then i use capitals that  first time.  For example GNU (=Gnu is Not Unix) and WINE (=Wine Is Not an  Emulator) and i have started using that unnecessary = sign to clarify what the  brackets are about.  I've probably been dealing with a lot of people that are  not used to reading lately and the annoying = seems to help.  People seem to  either ignore it, find it friendly, or appreciate it - i've not had much  feedback about it but had less follow-up questions when i use it.  I've not had  any complaints which is amazing imo.  Obviously there are exceptions such as  KDE, USA, GB (=Great Britain) although i do tend to do Uk and Gb (=Giga-bytes).  For the specific examples already mentioned i would favour   toolbar,  QuickStarter,  AutoRecovery (or perhaps auto-recovery if pushed)  I think i would prefer that contributors get mentioned vertically or in columns,  even if their work has subsequently been overwritten or replaced.  I prefer most  recent on top or alphabetically but again these are finesses that can be left  for now and sorted out in subsequent releases, after there has been discussion  to vote on preferences.  There is a guide about what work needs to be done (i think) urgently in some  sort of \"Resources\" section or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\"?

So we'd have \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide > V3.3.x\" and \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide > V3.4.x\"  Then we could move the Drafts, Proofread, Reviewed and Published folders under \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide\" into \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide > V3.3.x\", create \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide > V3.4.x\" and duplicate the  Drafts, Proofread, Reviewed and Published folders there for updating then.  I think that this would be the better solution from the viewpoint of the groups and permissions we'll set up after discussing the details on the list. Does that seem OK to you?   I'd love to get the versioning info out of the file name and into the document's meta data, so that - for instance - \"0101GS34-ChapterTitle.odt\" would become \"ChapterTitle.odt\" and that doc's meta data contains all the info we want to store about that doc. I remember we had a thread about this a few months ago, but we didn't reach a final decision about it, although you mentioned a number of items that should go in the meta data (I can dig that out when I get time today or tomorrow).  If we did decide to do as described above, I guess it would be rational to do it now before spawning the 3.4 docs. It would involve renaming every doc and inserting meta data; I'm perfectly OK to take part in that job or even do it all myself once/if we have agreed on the meta data. I could manage in in a pre-announced and approved one-day session, so that work does not get held up for other people. But guys would have to check-in all checked-out docs beforehand, and then check them out again after the process was finished.  (Alfresco can happily display a document's meta data, so it's not a problem of not being able to identify and distinguish between documents and versions).  What are everyone's thoughts about that?   Yes, I agree... many users might not upgrade to 3.4 for quite a while yet.   Yes, I guess so... Until such time as I get alfresco.libreoffice.org and media.libreoffice.org sorted out, I probably would not play a major part in that...   So what do we decide in the end? Go with your XP silver theme? Use the default theme from whatever distrib or OS the screenshooting person uses? Are we agreed that Windows screenshots are OK subsequent to the SC's kind-of pronunciation/recommendation about that? Or do we recommend a particular theme that can be availed in Windows/Mac/*nix versions? Or do we pragmatically accept whatever we can get from contributors, making the \"entry barrier\" as low as possible?  The word \"pragmatically\" sort-of suggests my own POV, but I'll go with whatever decision you and the team arrive at (unless other team members strongly and rapidly veto your recommendation, I think we should adopt it and move on quickly).   My own POV would be to make that a low priority or prefer to press ahead with new stuff. But I'll be guided by what you feel is best and +1 whatever you recommend (which I reckon we should adopt unless there is a strong veto by other team members).   Nothing I can think of.  "

Okay with me, as long as I'm not doing the work. ;-)   I think the consensus was: recommend, but not require, the \"Ubuntu XP-Silver\" theme. A similar-looking theme on other platforms is okay, but over time we'd like to replace non-standard images with those from a single platform/theme. I think this meets the \"pragmatic\" requirement (with which I agree) but works towards a more professional-looking result.    Two items I suggested can be done fairly quickly (dropping the \"Creating Web Pages\" chapter and the \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" appendix from Getting Started), but other items would take more work and/or are controversial. So at this point I think it's best to do only those two changes while updating the factual info for v3.4.x. That's assuming, of course, that a full set of files for 3.4.x is the way to go, instead of what Nino has just mentioned, which I'll return to in another note.  Also, *not* split the Writer Guide, since that was controversial. Time constraints may also mean not adding new chapters (that is, any that need to be written) to the Writer Guide on this update cycle.

The GS chapter on  \"Getting Started with Writer\" would be the same as the Writers Guide's  \"Introducing Writer\" and editing either in Alfresco would automatically update  the other.     There is extra info in the Writers Guide's Intro that is basically a brief  overview of LibreOffice generally.  The info there is fairly much the same in  all the other guides so could it form a separate chapter, probably just 2  pages.  Again, editing it in any guide would update the chapter in all guides.     We talked about this sort of thing briefly a few weeks ago in regards to the  Macros Chapter but i am still not certain about how feasable it is or even  whether it would be wise or not.     I think it would help each guide be a \"stand alone\" guide.  At the moment to  understand the Calc chapter on \"Macros\" people have to get the Getting Started  Guide.  It might help to consolidate the works and reduce the currently  duplicated workload for a few chapters.  It might make it easier for ODFauthors,  NeoOffice and Apache to adapt your guides to their forks = which would make this  team their upstream leader  :)  Obviously there would be disadvantages too, such as issues about context,  perhaps making guides a little larger, confusion for new editors.

However, if the team wants to make the 3.4.x series documentation deliberately  different from the 3.3.x then a few suggestions about now would be great.     I have a really bad feeling that i might have \"beaten people into submission\",  or forced them into doing something they hate.  So i would really appreciate  feedback from other members of the team even if that confirms my fears.     Regards from Tom :) "

So, it's still a race but not so bad this time :)  I don't think the \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" &amp; \"Creating Web-pages\" should be  dropped.

I don't have any objection to doing so; just wondering about your reason.   Okay with me, as long as I'm not doing the work. ;-)   I think the consensus was: recommend, but not require, the \"Ubuntu XP-Silver\" theme. A similar-looking theme on other platforms is okay, but over time we'd like to replace non-standard images with those from a single platform/theme. I think this meets the \"pragmatic\" requirement (with which I agree) but works towards a more professional-looking result.    Two items I suggested can be done fairly quickly (dropping the \"Creating Web Pages\" chapter and the \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" appendix from Getting Started), but other items would take more work and/or are controversial. So at this point I think it's best to do only those two changes while updating the factual info for v3.4.x. That's assuming, of course, that a full set of files for 3.4.x is the way to go, instead of what Nino has just mentioned, which I'll return to in another note.  Also, *not* split the Writer Guide, since that was controversial. Time constraints may also mean not adding new chapters (that is, any that need to be written) to the Writer Guide on this update cycle. Work on them, yes; get them ready for the following update cycle. But don't hold up the book to get them in.  --Jean     "

I don't know who else \"quite liked the idea of using a variety of themes\". *I* certainly didn't; I jokingly said it might have its merits, but the only reason I've supported not spending the time to deliberately change all the pix to a common theme is pragmatic: lack of time and people to do it, for no real advantage to users.    You have your timeline a bit mixed up. The silver theme was the original theme used in the OOo docs (with a few odd pix taken by other people, either on Windows or on Linux using a variety of other themes) and was not changed during the initial rebranding to LibO. The suggestion to use a different theme came while I was offline for several days, but by then several people had already started redoing Windows pix using one of the Ubuntu themes that didn't reproduce well in grayscale, so I nagged about it.

A similar-looking theme on other platforms is okay.

First, the link showed in the text does not exist. Second, if you look at the link associated with this text, it takes you to something other than what the text states, name, http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide. If LO has a site, then point to it. If LO does not have a site, then leave the OOo site. My guess is that this was simply a global text search and replace.

I found the very last text a bit amusing for this chapter:  Printed and eBook materials The following books are available for download:  And then, nothing is listed. Just a wee bit amusing. Unclear what should go there, but, some of the previous links may be useful.  The screen shots showing OpenOffice.org macros rather than Libreoffice macros in screen shots of the macro organizer are probably fine, but, they are wrong. Lots of work to fix those... One example is Figure 6.  A glaring omission in the document is that it does not mention that LO requires that recording macros must be enabled (Tools > Options > LibreOffice > General and then check \"Enable experimental (unstable) features). That is not required in OOo.  Any idea when the extensions library for LO will be online? It is referenced, but it takes you to a WIKI.

I know a lot of people that don't want to use OpenOffice or LibreOffice because Base don't supply their needs, they can't port ther MS Access databases directly, but the situation is worse: they can't make (from scratch) new databases in a easy way with Base, while yes with MS Access.  A lot of people don't know a lot of programming, but knows the minimum to create consistent databases with this type of software, and this same people don't want to pay another developer to make specific software with a lot of different technologies groupped together (mysql, and maybe qt, or gtk, or a web frontend made in php....). In little business, the people can't waste their time creating \"perfect\" information management systems, many times they have 1 only computer and it's a critical point the ability to make backups of the database copying one single file in a usb pendrive in one or two steps.

It is great to see people on the Users mailing list; 1. giving coding patches in answer to individual problems 2. helping regression test java and other dependencies  3. helping users switch from one back-end that 'should' work (but is broken) to  another that does work.    These are not trivial issues that the average office worker is likely to be able  to solve without a lot of hand-holding and intensive step-by-step help in the  Users list.  People experienced with  MS Access are not used to having to deal  with those sorts of problems.

It may have its fragilities at the moment, but I feel that it should definitely be kept in the suite and that we should still work on documentation for it.  I'm trusting that the project is going to, at some time hopefully soon, acquire some devs to work on it. After all, all of the components of LibreOffice can be improved in some way or other, but they're all progressively getting attention.  Base's turn will come, too.  "

When the discussion about which _additional_ database engine OOo should include. HSQLDB won, and SQLite lost. From my POV,the only reason HSQLDB won, was because it used Java. At the time, it was technically inferior to SQLite.  In an ideal world, there would be an extension that installs SQLite as if it were built into LibO, and provide a usable UI for database creation, editing, and viewing.   This relates to who creates databases.  There is a lot of useful theory, and practice in database construction and maintenance. For most projects, applying that theory would be helpful. Which is why database designers are very reluctant to allow non-database designers to create databases.  Or, more bluntly, don't like pre-built tools that non-database designers can use, to create, and use databases.  The simple reality is that when there is not an obvious, easy way to construct a database, people will use spreadsheets, blithely ignoring the fact that spreadsheets can, and will destroy their data. Then, since most people use spreadsheets instead of databases, development of database tools for Joe Sixpack gets lowered in priority, eventually reaching the point that databases for mortals are considered irrelevant.  this, what else is there in the opensource world?  PERL, Python, Ruby, etc.  world bare. Apparently one just writes one's own interface for them,  Historically, database engines have shipped without an interface. The user was expected to write their own UI. This presents the fewest restrictions on the database designer.  By way of example: I create resources for various Bible study programs.  These all use databases for the content. With a generic UI, I can't force record 31102 to be Revelation 22:21, or validate Vulgate versification as it is entered. With a custom UI, Vulgate versification can be input, and the data automatically converted to KJVA versification.   Database designers are the last hold out in the IT World, thinking that they are gods, and nobody else is pure enough to do what they do.  All that said, I do think that a manual that focuses on using the Base component as a front end to PosgreSQL, MySQL, Mariadb, Drizzle, MS Access, etc. A second manual, focusing exclusively on SQLite might be justified.  jonathon "

To use any database well requires more design and knowledge than simply slapping together a spreadsheet. A good database design must answer several design questions, very similar to software design. Essentially, a well designed database models logical groupings and the relationships between the groups within the data thus making easier to maintain and access.   SQL is not particularly hard to learn if you have some programming experience but difficult for non-programmers. Queries are often very straight forward but SQL requires accurate obedience to its syntax rules much like a programming language. "

An example: my fathers (mother and father) learned to use MS Access many years ago (arount 15 years), and designed many databases for friends and other people (as a \"job\", they earned money). Their first databases were .. hummmm... crap, but, hey!, those databases were better than the older software of their clients! O_O , they learned VB macros slowly, and making a lot of crappy designs (today they only know a very little subset of SQL). Well, at this moment I know a minimum of three databases made by they that are still running today, In my opinion these three databases are the worst crap i ever saw, but their users are happy with them -_- , happier than if they had to use only spreadsheeds, because their needs are too complex for only using spreadsheeds.  More examples? My best friend started to work in Seat (a spanish automotion company, part of WV), in theory as a junior mechanic engineer... but, wow!, his boss ordered him to make a MS Access database ... he didn't know anything about database design, but he could do the job in a reasonable time (ok, it was the BIGGEST CRAP i saw in my life, but worked... another time). In Seat they don't use LibreOffice or OpenOffice because Base is not really usable while MS Access, even if it's horrible, is working as they expect.  More: In the Faculty of Economics and Bussiness of the University of Barcelona... the same, they don't use LibreOffice or OpenOffice because they are tied to MS Access (and... uff, to SAP :s ) ... (they have a \"hole\" of 45 millions of euros, they don't like to pay for licenses, they pay because it's their \"only\" option... they don't know any other way of doing the work). In this case... I'm working to break many of these dependencies, I'm working on an online platform (with PHP and MySQL) to manage many of their crappy issues, but I'm only a scholarship holder in a little department.  Even if you don't believe it, people will learn to design databases without knowing theory if they have to do a lot of databases, and this (little) practical knowdlege may be the difference between having to pay a lot of money to an external developer or having the possibility to solve the problems without external help.  Why I think it's important Base? because it's potential integration with Writter and Calc , because when it's needed to make reports, and graphs, it's possible to export them as ODF documents, or to \"print\" them as PDF files... that's not a \"trivial\" task with other software stacks. And because the familiarity of users with \"old\" tools as MS Access, and the possibility to work without servers, and moving the data between computers using a single file (in many cases, I know that it's not true all the time).

Sorry to be a bother, but I do not know my way around well, and, I could not find the document that tells me how things should look, and, I do not want to change things if I am not sure that they should be done. So, where is the \"do it this way\" documentation? I am sorry for all the questions, but, this is my first LO document so I assume that the documents are as they should be and that everyone knows more than I.  For example:  QUESTION: A newly inserted figure (that is nicely done, by the way), does NOT contain a caption and is not in a frame. My instinct is to add a caption and place the figure in a frame, because it looks like this is true for all other figures. My assumption is that either (1) there is a reason this does not need to be done like the others, (2) Martin forgot, (3) Martin did not know better, or, the most likely yet, (4) Martin did everything perfectly, and Jean pulled it out and removed the caption to test me :-)  QUESTION: With OpenOffice.org, I always wrote OOo. For LibreOffice, should I use LibO rather than LO?  QUESTION: In the document, I found new text that reads similar to:  click Tools  Options  LibreOffice  General and tick the box Enable experimental (unstable) features.  I expected to see:  use Tools  Options  LibreOffice  General and tick the box Enable experimental (unstable) features.  If I wanted Italics, I expected to use the  style.    COMMENTS FOR MARTIN:  Martin, your new figures look great and it seems that you paid good attention to detail. I will change wording where it is not sufficiently precise; for example, when you state that the \"Writer Library\" is selected, it is really the Writer Module in the Martin Library. Without checking, my guess is that I introduced this error in the original.   "

The existing chapters are in two places: on the wiki (linked from this page) http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development#First_steps_with_the_Documentation_team   and on Alfresco under English Content > Documentation > Resources, where you will also find the current chapter template (don't get the book template by mistake; there are some differences).  Ignore the chapter titled \"Using LibreOffice's Alfresco website\" as it is very out of date and bears only occasional resemblance to the current website; David will update it when he finished tweaking the current site.    Not this time! I haven't touched the file. However, to answer the question, figure captions are not always necessary (this is discussed in one or another of the chapters of the Contributors' Guide) but in the case most likely Martin forgot.   We have been avoiding using an abbreviation, as there has been no real consensus about what abbreviation to use. Some books, such as the Getting Started guide, were done before we had sorted out some of the consistency issues, so you'll find it both internally inconsistent and not consistent with some of the other books. This will get sorted out in time.    You are correct. But we don't use \"tick the box\"; in this case I would say \"...and select the Enable experimental (unstable)    That is correct.

They  said that usually the 2 names would be used alongside each other for a long  while in order to transfer the brand-recognition from one to the other,  typically years.     Imagine if Nike changed their name and logo!  When \"marathon\" changed to  \"snickers\" they lost a lot of loyal customers (dunno how they measure this or  really know it).  It took a long time to build sales back up, apparently.   Granted that it's a different bottle of crisps for us but same idea applies.  I  don't really understand except from Naomi Klein's book \"No Logo\".  But the  marketing team asked for it and i see no reason to ignore their advice.

You need to clone the 'help' repository, and edit there:  git clone http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/help  Ideally using a normal text editor (Vim, Emacs, ...), and committing to git.  Unfortunately this is not as easy as editing the wiki pages; that's why all this wikihelp project has started :-)  Currently there is a Google Summer of Code student working on this (with me mentoring).  Unfortunately the switch cannot happen before the wikihelp -> native help convertor is finished, and works really well :-(   This document describes how to work with .xhp files:  http://documentation.openoffice.org/online_help/OOo2HelpAuthoring.pdf  But unfortunately it is not too convenient; and I have no idea how much has that changed since it was written (but the basic concepts are still valid).    Might be best to appear on the #libreoffice-dev mailing list, we'll help you there with git to get the most recent help, and with the .xhp files editing :-)  Thank you a lot, Kendy   "

Differences between it and the 3.3 template are small, but I thought it was best to create a new one instead of changing the old one... which could cause disruption if/when existing 3.3 chapters are updated to correct errors.  The main differences in the 3.4 template are the new or expanded explanations written by Gary and me and some reorganization of content. The explanatory text still needs improvement.  The template's explanatory content has been copied into a new chapter of the Contributors' Guide, titled \"Using the LibreOffice Chapter Template\". This chapter could probably benefit from some reworking.  The new chapter should be read in conjunction with the chapter on \"Producing LibreOffice User Guides\". There is some overlap, but mostly they are intended to supplement each other. You may find some inconsistencies between the two documents, because I have not had time to go through the \"Producing\" chapter to bring it up to date with the \"Template\" chapter. I also put the two files on the wiki.  I'll be away for the rest of the week, with intermittent email access and no opportunity to upload or download files.  --Jean   "

The Installing_extensions.odt document, in fact, is a merge of my new content with the previous document of Andreas (based on the extensions section of 0109GS3-SettingUpAndCustomizing.odt).    The document is here:    http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/File:Installing_extensions.odt (I removed the date on the name).    For this document, first of all, I suggest a review for correct English spelling and grammar, and improve any part of content, if it is necessary . The extension installation process is very simple to do, then, I think someone with good English can review it easily.    After review, Andreas can put a link to a PDF version of this document from the every extension page on the site.    Additionally, we can include the content of Installing_extensions.odt in the extensions section of 0109GS3-SettingUpAndCustomizing.odt or keep it as a different document. Sincerely, I don't know what is the better way. You can feel free for do it. :)    For the Publishing_extensions.odt document, there is a more complex review process. I agree with many comments of you: perhaps http://extensions-test.libreoffice.org can be modified or not. I have tested it many times and I think it needs only a few adjusts to be ready (Andreas has done a great job!). Because this, Publishing_extensions.odt is indeed a work in progress.    The document is here:   http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/File:Publishing_extensions.odt   (I removed the date on the name and I cropped the browse images in this version by suggestion of Jean,).    I think there are two ways for Publishing_extensions.odt.    A first way is to ask another extension(s) developer(s) to test the step-by-step of publishing a project on the website. After his vacation, Andreas can help us to find someone and can contribute with some comments himself. Then, I can update the document with the people comments. After, I will inform here about the moment to do an English spelling and grammar review.    A second possible way is more simple: someone do a English review now, Andreas put the document in the extensions website and we wait for comments by the developers.    In both ways, I wish to wait Andreas opinion.   Regards,  Gustavo Pacheco.      2011/8/13 Rainer Bielefeld    "

But I still miss at least a little bit of discussion on macros - at least how to record them, and maybe the kind of service they can render. Already Chapter 9 alludes to them in \"Assigning macros to events\" - how do we work that in without talking about how to create them in the first place? However, it is probably true that almost no beginners use them. Maybe a short appendix at the end on how to record them, with a cross-reference to in-depth coverage elsewhere?  I miss coverage of Base, but it's also true that Base is a tool that is difficult to cover in a \"quick, beginner guide\", because one quickly gets into complex explanations. How about a small section at least discussing the possible uses of Base integration in the other LibO components?  Maybe some similar coverage of Math, too?  So those are three possible alterations one could make.  Those points aside, your plan looks really good.   The plan looks good, but I might suggest putting the two parts - the \"more-elementary\" coverage and the so-to-speak \"advanced topics\" - inside one volume. That way, people with more commonplace needs get their info without having to wade through extraneous stuff, while people looking to do more sophisticated things can still find the information in one place without needing several books/PDFs open at the same time.  In the advanced section, I'd like to see at least some coverage of Math and how easy it is to insert equations. Same thing for Base integration. Same thing for drawings (as a complement to the spreadsheet coverage).  As you yourself have mentioned before in previous threads, and I whole-heartedly agree, Writer/Web really sucks as a means for producing Web pages. I couldn't imagine myself recommending someone to do it that way. In the context of the many other means of easy Web publishing available these days, I reckon it's almost an obsolete feature in its current implementation. I wouldn't give it much coverage except insofar as not to leave a blank hole in our documentation about the related menu items in the software.  But, basically, your ideas sound very good and probably cater more closely to users' real needs than the current material. In any case, I'm sure you're unlikely to overlook coverage of any important subject *somewhere* in the LibreOffice documentation, so I'd be happy to go with your ideas and assist you in developing them progressively.

I do take exception to a few items that were done while converting this from OOo  to LO (as it were); and perhaps a few dumb things that I may have done, but, I  won't bother to go back and check. Note, I only looked at the PDF.  The last page recommends that the user goes here for help: http://wiki.services.LibreOffice/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide  I see two issues with this. First, the link showed in the text does not exist.  Second, if you look at the link associated with this text, it takes you to  something other than what the text states, name,  http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide. If LO has a  site, then point to it. If LO does not have a site, then leave the OOo site. My  guess is that this was simply a global text search and replace. [note to self,  try to not do this, then I would look really silly]. Note, on closer inspection,  at least four links have been incorrectly set by this. Oh, I see another in  Table 1 on page 18.  I found the very last text a bit amusing for this chapter:  Printed and eBook materials The following books are available for download:  And then, nothing is listed. Just a wee bit amusing. Unclear what should go  there, but, some of the previous links may be useful.  The screen shots showing OpenOffice.org macros rather than Libreoffice macros in  screen shots of the macro organizer are probably fine, but, they are wrong. Lots  of work to fix those... One example is Figure 6.  A glaring omission in the document is that it does not mention that LO requires  that recording macros must be enabled (Tools > Options > LibreOffice > General  and then check \"Enable experimental (unstable) features). That is not required  in OOo.  Any idea when the extensions library for LO will be online? It is referenced,  but it takes you to a WIKI.

The bad news is that it still didn't resolve the issue of the inability, under the Share interface (http://alfresco.libreoffice.org), to browse folder names with an accented character in their name. This problem currently eludes me, and I'll be working on troubleshooting that with Jeff Potts, Alfresco's Chief Community Officer.  However, that doesn't affect the work of the English docs team, and the Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese teams can still successfully do any work they like via the Explorer interface at http://documentation.libreoffice.org, which will not be retired before the above problem is solved.  Aside from the aforementioned troubleshooting, our next task will be to get a system of user groups, permissions and workflow rules in place.  I don't expect to be able to do anything myself about this before the weekend, but Jeremy might possibly be doing some.  @Tom: thanks for the kind words. ;-)  "

In 4 of those Chapters it might be easier just to replace the Silver themed  screen-shots to make the chapters consistent in themselves even if that makes  them inconsistent with the rest of the guide(s).

Please look for errors like this:  * Missing x-refs (marked by \"Error! xxxx\") or wrong x-refs (usually to  the wrong figure number) * Incorrect list numbering (not starting with 1, or following items in a list not numbered sequentially) * Missing figures * Up to date info on the copyright page (email address, date of publication, OOo version, and website address in footer) * Characters, words, graphics (especially circles and callouts on  other graphics) in wrong places on the page * Conspicuously bad page breaks; for example, the lead-in sentence to  a list on one page, with all of the list on the next page, or a table  row split over two pages, or a very large blank space at the bottom of  a page because a graphic or table has gone to the next page when it  should not have done so * And anything else that looks wrong  This sort of checking can be done fairly quickly, because you should be skimming, not reading in detail.  At this point you should NOT primarily be looking for minor wording inconsistencies and other issues. Of course, if you find errors do let us know.   --Jean   "

Therefore I have put a set of Getting Started files on Alfresco in English Content > Documentation > Getting Started > Drafts V3.4.x  Below is my list of what needs to be done to update to V3.4, plus some minor improvements (that could be skipped). These are collected here: http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development#Getting_Started_Guide  Similar lists for the other books are coming soon.  --Jean  GETTING STARTED GUIDE: Updates for LibO V3.4.x =====================  General: check screenshots for changes. Use silver/gray theme for any replacements needed. In many cases (Chapter 4,5,6,7) the component guide will contain a newer image that can be used in this book without necessity of recapturing/redoing.   On copyright page of each chapter: * Use \"data table\" coloring style for the table of Mac usage info. * Change LibO version number and publication date.  Chapter 1 (Intro)  * Verify system requirements and all URLs. * Passwords can now be changed while document is open; add to section on password protecting a doc.  Chapter 2 (Setup)  * Internationalized font previews: Fonts which are tuned for use with a specific script, e.g. Arabic, Hebrew, Malayalam, etc. now show an additional preview of some sample text in the target script. Mention in Setup bit on font preview  Chapter 3 (Styles &amp; Templates)  * Mention that manual (\"direct\") formatting over-rides styles, and how to remove it.  Chapter 4 (Writer)  * Find toolbar: revise info * Add brief info on Paragraph and Character *style* dialogs to reinforce message that styles are preferred to manual formatting. * Mention that manual (\"direct\") formatting over-rides styles, and how to remove it. * Slightly amend info on View Layout to say that the effect varies with zoom and window width.  Chapter 5 (Calc)  * Redesigned Move/Copy Sheet dialog (Edit->Sheet->Move/Copy) - put in section on \"working with sheets\". * Add a few words on sheet tab colors (get words from Calc Guide). * Add a few words on total and subtotals? * Mention Pivot Tables (formerly DataPilot) and refer reader to Calc Guide. * Add a few words on functions and formulas, refer reader to Calc Guide.  Chapter 6 (Impress)  * Especially check this chapter for visual differences in the user interface. * \"Media clip\" is now \"Movie\" (especially in screenshots). * Add reference to bundled Presenter Console extension.  Chapter 7 (Draw)  * Curves toolbar is shown twice; second instance is redundant - remove it. * Use new pix from Draw Guide in several places.  Chapter 8 (Base)  * Needs to be checked for accuracy, in case something has changed. Somewhere I have a note with info on one error; I'll find it.  Chapter 9 (Math)  * Add reference to Math Guide &amp; the tables of info in it.  Chapter 11 (Graphics)  * Replace Imagemap dialog picture with one from Writer Guide.  Chapter 14 (Customizing)  * Color Charts: Adding and Removing color charts is now possible from Tools->Options->Charts->Default Colors. There is nothing about Chart colors in the book, and I think it fits better under \"Customizing\" (Ch 14) than it does under \"Setup\" (Ch 2).    "

Based on the feedback from Andreas Mantke and your draft, I've drafted  this one - thoughts welcome!  == LibreOffice launches extension and templates repository for public beta test  Developers invited to contribute their addons Community-based review process ensures quality and reliability  LibreOffice, the free office productivity suite, can be enhanced with hundreds  of extensions and templates. Users can download these smart extras to improve  the suite's functionality to fit their job or hobby, and developers can easily  write their own add-ons and share it with millions of users worldwide.  Since at the moment there is no reliable and stable source for downloading these  handy add-ons, the LibreOffice community has put great efforts into launching a  public repository. It does not only provide extensions and templates for  LibreOffice, but also for OpenOffice.org and other compatible office suites.  Users of these can benefit from the work and the commitment of our community,  and are invited to have a look at recent versions of our product, which already  has included has the most popular extensions, and comes with many new features.  The new site is now in public beta testing at  http://extensions-test.libreoffice.org and has been created in cooperation with  the Plone community, on whose technology it is based. To ensure the quality and  reliability of the offered extensions, a community-based review process is  currently set in place: Community volunteers test and review available  extensions, and those meeting criteria of quality will be tagged accordingly.  We warmly invite all developers to submit their extensions and fill the  repository, where millions of users worldwide will be able to download and  benefit from their work. All extensions submitted during the public beta test  will remain in the repository after the beta test, so this is your chance to  join the efforts right from the beginning! ==  Florian  "

Therefore the Help that comes with Alfresco isn't going to be much help; best to ignore it.  David Nelson is still working on the customisation, so the chapter on \"Using LO's Alfresco website\" is out of date in some places and unlikely to be updated until David has reached a stable point in the customisation.  So... at this time we are using this user interface to Alfresco: http://documentation.libreoffice.org/ NOT alfresco.libreoffice.org. The instructions in \"Using LO's Alfresco website\" are accurate for most of that user interface. (I will update that line in the document now, because that is the single most misleading statement in the existing document.)  When using that interface, the instructions for editing offline show the row of icons that appear under the document (on the other interface, the icons are off to the right-hand side). The first icon (Edit Offline) locks the file (to show others that it is being worked on) and creates a working copy for you to download and edit.  The statement about putting your \"wiki user id\" (whatever that is!) in the \"checkout\" column\" refers to a page on the wiki, not on Alfresco (similar to OOo's task list page). So far, I don't think anyone is actually using that LO wiki page to track work.  Hope this helps, and sorry about the confusing instructions.

I'll be addressing the problem as soon as possible. Meanwhile, do feel free to ask any questions here on the list, and I'll respond as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.  @Jean: I'm busy on a client project for the next 10 days to come, and I'm also waiting for mail back about the 2 key problems with the Share interface: inability to use accented characters in folder names, and a curious problem with uploading .odt files that has emerged recently (it *would* have to be .odt files rather than any other format... there's no problem uploading PDFs, and it's only in the English content space, not any of the other ones). The upgrade did not fix those problems.  If I don't find rapid solutions to the aforesaid issues, maybe it would be pragmatic to side-step them and simple work with the Explorer interface (http://documentation.libreoffice.org), which has no such problems. That way, I can give a green light to Jeremy to re-implement the workflow described in his original guide, and we can update the contributor documentation quickly.  After that, the other problem I'm wrestling with is configuring the Drupal installation at http://media.libreoffice.org to interact with Alfresco, so that we get a public no-login showcase for the content on Alfresco.  As soon as I've dealt with the above, I'll be available to work on documentation - starting with the Power User Guide to be developed from the existing technical writer's guide contributed by those students.  I'll be following up on my last unanswered mail to my mentor this weekend. I'll mail back to the list with news as soon as possible - certainly sometime within the next 2 weeks.

I may be giving you more than you need, but maybe the documentation folks can make use of this in some way too.   - Dennis   1. FINAL SHOWING MARKUP  \"Final Showing Markup\" is a Track Changes option in Microsoft Office.  (The other options are Original, Original Showing Markup, and Final).  Final Showing Markup appears to be the default setting.  \"Final Showing Markup\" shows how the document will appear when all changes are accepted, and what the changes are that leave it in that shape.  This option has been available in all versions of Microsoft Word *since* Office 2000.  What that means, when using Word, is that insertions are marked by underlining but that deletions don't show in the text.  Instead, deletion points are linked to balloons in the margin that show what was deleted.  (In case you were wondering, Original Showing Markup has the insertions in marginal balloons and deletions are strikeouts in the text.)  There is a description of this at  http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/sharing/howtousethereviewingtoolbar.html>.   2. IN-LINE ONLY CHANGES - ALL THAT LIBREOFFICE HAS  In Microsoft Office, there is also a kind of tracked-changes presentation where both insertions (colored and underlined usually) and deletions (different color, with strikethrough usually) are all in the running text.  This is accomplished by turning off the balloon feature.  In Libre Office, this is the *only* way that tracked changes can be shown.  If you look at Tools | Options | LibreOffice Writer | Changes you will see what is under your control.   3. THE GOOD NEWS    3.1 If, with the final draft you are being asked to review, set the Changes options to something your editor is asking to see, such as Insertions Underlined and in Light Blue color.  Deletions with Strikethrough and Red color.  Changed attributes Underlined Double and Color Magenta 4 or so.  I don't know if he wants to see change marks, but you can leave them on the left margin and black.    3.2 IN FACT, these setting apply to the software being used to view the document.  The settings don't travel with the document.  A reviewer will see their settings applied as if that is what you used.  You do have to turn on Record and Show in the Edit | Changes ... menu though.    3.3 IF YOU ARE LUCKY, your editor will open the document for Review with Final Showing Markup and will see exactly what is being expected.  You might warn the editor that the setting might have to be selected after opening the document in Word.   4. THE BAD NEWS    4.1 I don't know if you have been turning back change-marked documents, or receiving change-marked documents.  If you have, you probably know how careful you have to be.    4.2 To put it politely, interoperability of change-tracking across formats is not terrific.  Extensive changes and rearrangements can be messed up something also when there is a conversion between formats.    4.3 CAREFUL, SMALL STEPS SHOULD WORK.  I assume your manuscript is not complex.  So long as you are down to correcting typos and short wordings, you should be fine.  Instead of making a change between two paragraphs or across other mixes of materials (list items, text flowing across images, table rows), keep the changes small.  Make multiple small changes, rather than big ones that span units of text.  This works best if your document is not done against an exotic template and has rich features as well as text.    4.4 CONFIRM IF YOU CAN.  If you have a Word viewer, you might be able to see if the change-tracking goes across all right.  If saving as .doc and then reopening it in LibreOffice looks fine, you are probably all right too.  (But you might still be all right but unable to confirm it if round trip to .doc and back into LibreOffice deviates in some way.)    -----Original Message---"

Errors and Suggestions for LibreOffice Writer Guide.  /Page 57./ To match the screen-shot, the last sentence of the text above Figure 58 ought to read ... In the example, English (Australia) has been chosen for all the appropriate settings except User Interface..  /Page 195./ The third line of the fourth paragraph reads For example, if you decide that all the headings should be blue (such as in this guide), you only . The word 'blue' should be replaced with the word 'green', as all headings are green.  /Page 290./ The text of step 8 should match the screen-shot in Fig. 303 (as it does in the OpenOffice.org Writer guide page 353 for its Fig. 295).  /Page 292./ Step 5 refers to a non-existent step 7. It is likely that the paragraph below Fig. 307 starting The document is now .. should be numbered as step 7.  /Page 293./ Fig. 307 screen-shot does not match the text, showing as it does ![Points.Sheet1.Last Name] instead of ![Points.Sheet1.Company] as in the text of step 6c. The text/screen-shot is also referred to on page 297, in step 4.  /Page 294./ Suggestion. The unnumbered screen-shot with a large black ellipse contained within, appears unnecessary. The text within the paragraph appears to be adequate in describing what's present. In the event that a screen-shot is deemed necessary, then the large black ellipse surely is not required, given that only two choices are available.  /Page 296./ Step 6's last sentence is incorrect and should read ;otherwise continue with Removing blank lines from labels.  /Page 297./ The '*Caution*' should read step 3) not step c).  /Page 298./ In the 'Printing' section, step 3's 4^th paragraph should be 6 and not 6f.  /Page 299./ The /*TIP */is wrong. Both the Addressee and Sender dimensions can be altered in their Position boxes. Clicking the *New Doc. *Button with the dimensions shown**in the screen-shot shown below produces an envelope document with the fields placed as directed. Has the screen-shot for Fig. 313 been taken from OpenOffice.org Writer? A bug(?) in their Writer prevents the fields in the envelope layout being seen, though I believe it's been rectified for their next release. LibreOffice shows it correctly as shown below. I suggest the screen-shot is replaced with a LibreOffice screen-shot.    /Page 300./  I think step 4's second paragraph should read and dropping, /*then*/click..., and not and dropping, /*than*/click ....  /Suggestion/. Redo paragraphs 4 and 5 as below. This change brings the setting of the Sender box to a point before the setting of the Addressee fields, particularly for anyone being directed off to drag and drop.  4) Select the *Envelope *tab. (Fig 315 inserted here). Choose whether or not to add Sender information to the envelope by selecting or deselecting the Sender check-box. If wanted, edit the information in the Sender box (Sender is the fromon the envelope). You now have the choice of creating the Addressee fields by dragging and dropping from the data source headings (as described in Creating a form letter on page 291, and in particular in Figure 305) or using the facilities of this tab.  If you prefer dragging and dropping, then click *New Doc.*, drag your data source headings into the Addressee area on your new envelope and skip to step 7), otherwise continue with steps 5 and 6.   5) Verify, add, or edit the information in the Addressee box. You can use the right-hand drop-down lists to select the database and table from which you can access the Addressee information, in a similar fashion to that described for Printing mailing labels, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 on page 295. The similarity of the method with Figure 311 and Figure 312 will be clear..  /Page 301./ /Suggestion. Step/ 6's third paragraph to read as follows.  You can now further modify the placement and size of the frames containing the sender(if inserted) and addressee information, or make further changes to the character and paragraph attributes (for example, the font) or add a logo or other graphic to the envelope. Modify the frame by first clicking on the frame's boundary; modify its size by clicking on and dragging the green handles; change its position by clicking and dragging from within the frame's boundaries..  The /*TIP */within step 7 ought to reclassified as a /*NOTE */as it only explains why the following text is there and points out a similarity with another section.  /Error?. /Step 7 c). At the end of the first sentence, change 'label' to 'envelope'. In the second sentence, add the word 'character' between 'line' and 'and' thus; the new line /character /and then press ....  /Page 302./ Paragraph 3 of /*Merging and printing the envelopes. */The following text is wrong.

The linux version has a name something like java-1.6.0_21 The _20 that is in some distros repos is fine, not quite as good but good  enough.  Likewise the _22 is ok too.  The _23 seems to be slow and causes  problems for some people while the _24 and onwards seem to cause a lot of  problems even crashing LibreOffice for some people.     Oracle are developing java which i find interesting.  OpenJDK, which is  recommended in the release notes for LibreOffice, seems to cause a few problems  for people and i think it's just not as highly developed, yet.  I'm sure it will  get there and the coding is probably a lot more elegant and secure given the  nature of these projects.     I think people will need to have 2 versions of java; one for their web-browser  and one for LibreOffice until the code clean-up has removed any dependence on  java.     I don't know if there is documentation about how to install 2 versions of java,  or if it's easy or if documentation refers to versions of java somewhere.  Would  be a good plan to mirror the java that Tim has uploaded to make sure it is still  accessible for LibreOffice users?

I have both printed and pdf versions of major books about Access and VBA (1000 pages plus in some cases) from Que, O'Reilly etc.  The point is, that at a certain point, the questions I have are not answered in these books. I find the answers on forums and other web based resources via Google. Some blogs and wikis are useful also.  A second point is the speed of access. It is (usually) slower to search a book (one pdf at a time) than to use Google. Of course with a text search facility like Recoll (Linux) or Sleuthhound (Windows) searching becomes more efficient, but still limited to what you have on your hard drive/local server(s). And this does not address the online/offline questions, nor problems encountered by those with slow internet access speeds.  But my point is, we have all this really good _basic_ information contained in the Guides.   What about the power users? Who addresses their needs? Do we need some sort of cookbook of ideas/FAQs or whatever in a Wiki format? Harvested from user forums etc? I remember some years ago we had or were looking at a system of harvesting ideas - I think Jonathan was across it IIRC?? The sheer number of posts and checking if proposed solutions are still applicable would be horrendous to perform manually I suppose. This does not attempt to propose a solution, just stimulate some ideas.  Interesting that Ubuntu have also recognised the need to cater for both \"newbies\" and power users with the release of 11.04 - perceived by many power users (Linus T included) as a dumbing down of the system.  just a few cents worth of thoughts this morning regards M "

        "text": "Hi Barry On Linux the location of installed programs can vary widely. Many are put into /usr/bin. If you compile from source often the prefix will be /usr/local/bin. In \"olden\" times it was normal that /opt was the location of \"optional programs.  Have a look at http://slashmedia.wordpress.com/2007/12/23/linux-directory-structure/ or google around a bit and you will find the history of the unix folder structure.  But OOo and LibO have used /opt as the top level folder for all builds which have come from the organisations themselves.  The problem comes when you have installed a customised version of one of these packages. I mean customised by Canonical/OpenSuSE etc. Then the folder in which it may be found can and does differ from the \"original\".  That is what you have found out! :=)  You can install other versions of the program to use a more up to date build, and it will (if downloaded from the OOo/LibO site) install into the /opt folder. If it is a stable build it will go into (for example) /opt/openoffice.org or /opt/libreoffice3.4. If a pre release build it probably ends up in /opt/ooo-dev or /opt/lo-dev.  It is quite feasible to have multiple versions of the programs installed. I have LO3.4 and 3.4m1 daily build as well as OOo 3.4beta on my laptop. Running different versions concurrently can be a bit tricky.  The other gotcha is the association of file extensions. Your originally installed version in /user/lib/.... will probably be the version opened if you double click an odt file.  It is relatively simple to change these file associations if you want.  Adding additional menu entries is often not necessary if you have installed the -kde-integration or -gnome-integration packages. Of course this is a generalisation and all generalisations are false.  Feel free to shout on this list if you need more help, there are plenty of people \"lurking\", and most of the Linux power users are much better qualified than me to give advice.  regards Martin  Barry Smith  wrote:    "

I've written a minor book and done some journalism, as well as a little bit of simple blogging.  Some of my articles in the past have been how-tos, as well as op/ed pieces.  Anyway, I've been pretty quiet the last few years and thought I might try to help out a little.  In particular, I'd like to help out with Base documentation.  It will be closer to October before I can do anything at all, but I thought I would at least throw my name in the hat.  Kind regards, Don "

It was originally written to cover installation on a variety of popular Linux distribs, but became somewhat unwieldy.  Since that time, I have seen a few LibO installation guides for particular Linux distribs, and they were actually much easier to read since they were tackling a smaller scope of one distrib.  I have it on my not-so-small to-do list to review Nino's edits, but this is not likely to happen any time very soon...  "

It's running on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 11.04. The performances are even better than before.  The previously-existing problems have been resolved: it's now possible to use accented characters in folder names under Share, and there is now no problem uploading .odt files under Share.  My plan is to manually copy across all our data from the existing Alfresco, so as not to accidentally migrate the previously-existing problems. I'll be posting back about that before proceeding, so as to negotiate a freeze on work for a 24-hour period.  I expect to get this finished by early to middle of next week, i.e. around September 15 at latest. Then there will be a transparent rollover after prior warning on the list.  After that, my focus will be on the documentation production workflow on Alfresco, and on bringing the Drupal-powered public browser front-end at http://media.libreoffice.org to operational status. I'll be posting back with more news/ideas about that once the rollover has been completed.  In parallel with the work on workflow, I'll be updating the Alfresco coverage in the contributor's guide so that new team members can get started more easily.  All the above is taking a little time as I'm also extremely busy on a big client project. But we are getting there steadily.  So, more news fairly soon.  "

I have a backup on my local system in addition to one on the new server and a backup of the old server partition. I'll be restoring everything fairly much as it was on the old server, but taking account of a workflow that I have devised with Jeff Potts of the Alfresco project (more about that soon).  As soon as the data is restored, I'll be updating the contributor documentation so that people can get good guidance in using the Alfresco Share interface. It's much faster and more user-friendly than the old Explorer interface - especially since the new server is a 100%-dedicated machine with 8Gb of memory.  Good news is that the past problem of inability to browse folders with accented characters in the folder name has now been solved, so that localization teams will be able to make effective use of the new system.  In addition, I can install language packs so that many localization teams will be able to use the platform in their preferred language.  I have not yet migrated user accounts. Anyone who would like access before I do can post here to the list, and I will quickly create you an account and send you new credentials.  I'll write back with more news in a few days when I've done more work, but I'll that won't be before the weekend.

In many cultures it is impolite to criticise at all but in English and American culture you have to criticise quite rudely before anyone takes any notice. I think some of us are unclear whether you are saying that 1.  there definitely is a problem but you are naturally being polite and avoiding saying so or  2.  you have a vague feeling there might be a problem or 3. you don't think there is a problem but want to be prepared just in case there is one.   The copyright license of the books is a special one that allows modification and re-licensing. I think that if you do make changes, such as replacing the images then the new licence has to be the same type of license as the old one.   If you require it then it might be reasonably easy for David to set-up a new area for your project. Normally that is done for translations but i am fairly sure it could be done for your teacher's guides. That way you could work at getting higher resolution images for the screen-shots. Some people here might help with it and/or people involved with the teacher's guides locally?   I think on TDF lists you can happily be quite rude and say exactly what you need. We are all friends even those of us that appear to argue and disagree all the time.  Regards from Tom :)  -"

        "text": "Hi :) I think that selling it is fine.   Have the printers tried printing a page that has images such as screen-shots? That would give us a good idea of whether the picture resolution needs to be improved or not. It would be a good for us to get feedback about that anyway.   Costs have to be covered somehow and a bit more to help cover unexpected problems and even make a little profit is fine too. Have a look at how much Lulu charge to get an idea of what you can do.  http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/getting-started-with-libreoffice-33/14703788 I think any extra money raised should go into your project there rather than back to TDF, unless you make millions! You wont need to buy the books frrom Lulu as your project is printing it's own and again that is fine so just set price according to what you feel is appropriate. I'm not sure how schools are funded there so it might not be possible for them to pay anything. If that is the case then it might be good to print the books showing a price but then allow the schools a reduction (to zero or whatever) so that if people want to buy additional books then they might be able to.    It does seem like an excellent and very worthwhile project. It is good to know that you are doing this :) Regards from Tom :)   -"

Expressed in quantitative terms, screen-capture resolutions are typically only 72 or 96 dpi--quite low resolution for print docs. At bare-minimum resolutions, a high-quality (Adobe Acrobat print-file term...) PDF to be sent to a commercial print shop would have 300 dpi for raster graphics (e.g., photos) and 1200 dpi for line art. Therefore, a typical screenshot would often appear fuzzy and have other faults in a printed book.  Vector graphics (e.g. via graphical PDFs or other file formats) should be used whenever available because they can be scaled up or down in size while not presenting low-resolution problems.

There might be a few teams interested or perhaps the Extensions translations might be good to place there even if the rest of translations fro a particular language get doen elsewhere?
