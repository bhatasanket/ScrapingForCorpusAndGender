I'm currently into reading Alfresco dev documentation, and am thinking that it would be good for us to try and get people from the Alfresco project to give us some assistance there.  But if you would like to do work on things yourself, Jeremy, then do feel free.

However, I get mail notifications of document additions, edits and updates on Alfresco (these will be sent to a dedicated public mailing list as soon as the notification templates are configured to contain more-useful information than at present).  I now have a lot more time again. Personally, I plan to focus on configuring and developing the Alfresco platform as my first task, working from suggestions and discussion from the English docs team and interested localization people.  Alfresco has many potentials as a working tool, for documentation work, for localization work, and for other areas of the LibreOffice project / TDF organization too. I continue to see it as an ideal tool for LibreOffice documentation, and want to get the Alfresco project involved in helping us get the most out of it quickly. I probably need to do more communication about Alfresco to the LibreOffice lists, so that people get a better understanding of what it can be used for.  But, obviously, no-one is obliged to use Alfresco if they have other preferred tools and methods.  In any case, I'll post again soon with more Alfresco news and ideas.  As regards LibreOffice English/localized documentation, whatever platform is used for docs team work, we recently discussed the need to finalize a document reference system. Notably it needs to be platform independent (fields contained in document meta data, for instance). That would be something we should do pretty urgently, IMHO.  David Nelson  "

So I prefer the \"leadership\" to float and simply fall de facto on the most-active member(s) of the team at a given moment.  IMHO, each contributor should feel liberty of action and freedom to take a lead role in an initiative, without feeling they have to defer to an official or unofficial team leader. I like the way people have been discussing and negotiating together about work, without any one person feeling they have a weightier opinion than someone else.  On balance, I'd say no to a permanent team leader at this time.  -1  David Nelson  "

People will be able to see all stuff in any space, and download it. When it's publication-ready, it will be copied from the Alfresco platform to the LibreOffice wiki, where it will be listed there and on the main LibreOffice website (libreoffice.org).  When you do work, it's best to come and announce your plans/intentions here on the Documentation mailing list, so that other team members can advise you and be aware of what's in progress.  Insofar as you use the Alfresco platform for your work, there is not currently any \"acceptance\" process. What will happen is that another team member will take a look, and probably do the next work task. We'd only roll back your upload and reject the work if there was some dire problem with it.  Again, when you finish work, post a message here to let people know - although there will be a public commits mailing list reporting work on the Alfresco platform operational in an unfinished form later today.  Parichay, it's great to have everyone possible putting work in on English docs, but I'd also urge you to go on the l10n list and ask about localization work. It is likely that there is no-one working on content for your mother tongue.  Speaking personally, I've always felt that, insofar as possible, it's best to have mother-tongue writers doing the authoring, otherwise there is an extra job for us of post-editing to weed out grammar errors, etc. Although it is true that there tend to be more exceptions to this principle with English, as it's a widely-spoken international language. But, in any case, don't let that discourage you from contributing to English content if it attracts you more than working with your mother tongue. More info about localization work is here [1].

Again I agree, but as stated in my original note, several people have asked for someone to lead the group. Perhaps Jeremy or others can say what they would like the role of leader to encompass.  Actually what I am most interested In is the user guides, not the whole overall documentation effort, and I would much prefer to have at least one person taking responsibility for each book rather than one person for all of them.

Plus, a team leader should only be appointed by team vote after a competitive process. And the term and roles of a team leader would have to be clearly defined beforehand.  A team vote by the Engilsh docs team should only be conducted among recognized and active English docs contributors who are accepted LibreOffice community members. The basic principles of the community bylaws would really suggest that.  The MC has only just started work on intaking community members, and so the subset of approved community members and active English docs team contributors is still very fuzzy and evolving.  The English docs project could only benefit from a period of competitive contribution between contenders for the team leader position, and there are a number of people that I can think of who have excellent qualifications (Jean included). In around six months, the LibreOffice project and, certainly, the English docs project would then be in a much more mature situation, and a defendable vote could then be held.  To date, I have noticed that every single active contributor to EngDocs (I just coined a tag for the team name!) has a tendency to need to go MIA from time to time to deal with other stuff in daily life (\"disappear off in the bush\"). And there has been quite some churn among the contributors. So you couldn't really take a proper vote at this time that could credibly be proposed to and defended before the SC.  @Jean: if the situation has now changed for you and you feel able to put contribution to LibO EngDocs before your work for ODFAuthors and OpenOffice.org, then that's really superb and what I've encouraged you about for a long time, on- and off-list. I'll be extremely happy to collaborate with you on your ideas and proposals for the LibreOffice documentation project, and to contribute helpfully to the work as much as possible.  @Jean, all: But, personally, I'd say let's put off the idea of any team leader until September or October, and work as from now on organizing a proper framework for things (the EngDocs project generally, and the possible appointment of a team leader).

The original organization was somewhat illogical and disjointed, so I cobbled it together differently. The modified template guide has a _mod_0 suffix affixed to the original filename, as a couple months ago I made several substantive changes to it and labeled that one with a _mod_1 suffix and added a \"changes list\" first-level subhead at the end of it, which shows the edits, comments,  and such changes from the previous versions.  The changes I made back then have not yet been uploaded, probably due to \"cabin fever\" here or the like, as this past? winter in Detroit (it still snowed in late April this year...) was/is at least two months longer and some 5 to 20 degrees colder than normal--with some 19 more inches of snow and 50% more rain than usual.

Some of you guys really need to learn some Zen. :-)  I am only one human being, and at the time I was working on the LibreOffice website - an urgent need for the project at that time - I did not have *much* time for contributing to docs, although I did respond to every inquiry and question on the docs mailing list. At the time, some people were pretty grateful for the fact that I practically \"dragged\" libreoffice.org forward to live status, almost single-handedly. But all that gets forgotten pretty quickly! :-D  As regards the Alfresco server problem, it was extremely unfortunate about the problem that occurred with the original Alfresco installation, and you can imagine I felt pretty bad myself.

Now Alfresco is being backed up externally to a TDF server every 3 hours, in addition to complete server backups three times a week to an off-site location.  In addition, I've contacted the Alfresco project to invite them to help us get the best out of Alfresco within a short time frame. I'll post about that as soon as I have more news.  BTW, I have responded to the backlog of mailing list stuff having accumulated over about 4 weeks, and have responded to direct mail, too. Notably, I have responded to every inquiry and request concerning Alfresco.  Anyway, I've stated my opinions above in this thread, without unpleasantness or rudeness to anyone, and I stand by them. I'm pretty thick-skinned, and am perfectly able to take a lot of flack from people, as well as give it back in reasonable measure. And I still believe in LibreOffice and intend to keep working with the English docs team.  So you can expect to keep reading me on this list. ;-)  David Nelson  "

He seemed unwilling  to go for a leadership position expressing reservations about it but i kinda  pushed him into it and that all back-fired on me.  Many co-operative groups run extremely well without a specific leader, running  by committee/council or by whoever happens to be most active in a particular  sub-group at that particular time (like a relay race).  We seem to be happily  going on like that already so i think it's questionable as to whether we really  need a single leader at all.     I realise that most people are more comfortable taking orders unquestioningly  from higher authorities and need to set someone up to be in charge over them  rather than thinking for themselves and taking responsibility for their own  actions but hierarchical organisations are much less robust than co-operative  enterprises.  What happens when the leader is away or orders something daft or  has a personality clash with someone?  A committee would deal with those  situations smoothly without any ripples.  Hierarchical organisations tend to  fall apart with even simple and obvious problems such as that..  I think this documentation group needs to formalise it's current structure (ie  what are the \"working groups\" = sub-groups) and just clarify who is  representative on our little committee.  Each representative needs a 2nd person  or perhaps each group needs 2 people to represent them.  At the moment we have  not really given thought to what groups we need and who would represent them but  i would say the groups at the moment are;    Alfresco web-site and very technical issues = David Alfresco work-flow and practical how-to = Hal Non-alfresco work-flow, guidance and tech issues = Jean  Ideally we would have 6 groups including some sort of administration / steering  group in order to keep people from \"ganging up on each other\" too easily but  artificially creating unnecessary groups is a very bad plan as it can just  create extra \"make work\".  For examples of good co-operative type organisations look at Mondragon in Spain  or Italy (i think) or Suma or Radical-Routes (or is it Roots?) in the UK.   However both the first 2 are much larger and more corporate than we need to be  and the last is extremely low-tech and might not even have a web-presence at  all.  Look up worker co-ops in your area and you might get a few surprises.   Here, just north of London England, we have 1 worker co-op that made components  for the space shuttles although it's more recent products might be less familiar  to home-users.  Most people might know of \"social enterprise\" co-ops or social  firms such as furniture, recycling or grocery stores.  I think it might be  because of those grocery stores and such-like that people don't take co-op  structures seriously but many high tech organisations also try to avoid being  too hierarchical because hierarchies are less robust and less innovative  (oddly).  This is all stuff that people working in OpenSource projects should already grok  right to the core of their soul  because it's exactly the sort of thing that  makes MS so vulnerable to malware compared to OpenSource projects which are  robust.     \"Just following orders\" has been a very poor excuse for some extremely bad moves  throughout history.  So, lets avoid hierarchical structures and keep things  robust &amp; open to innovation but lets formalise which groups are needed and  identify who is in charge of each group.  Perhaps we could have elections if  it's not obvious who is best at what.

And then there is the wiki and the users mailing list ...  the companies that will make the transition to our software will do (at least the majority of them) a in-house training of some sort. We start out as being EXPENDABLE, our work is futile and is outdated as soon as we print it ... but am I with all this, still having FUN? Sure, so I continue ... when it seems to much like work, I'll get out the same day.  This is not to say that any of you are right or wrong, but we need to get our speech in the same wave length. But just to make my point perfectly clear: This discussion is happening because people think the project is THEIRS (or at leas that they are PART of it) when the actual situation is that we are DONATING time and work to the project, we are not the project (and that is a good thing, or the hole project would stop if we weren't here any more).  So ... are YOU still having FUN ?  Rogerio  "

There might be a nearly complete document that just needs a couple of paragraphs  sorting or something. I guess i mean that mentorship is not something a leader  should get \"bogged down in\" and straight tech-support is also not a function of  leadership.    Ok, so are the groups something like;  1.

Is Alfresco similar  enough to Mallard to make transition easy for them if they join us/you?  Now we  have documentation about using Alfresco it should be easier for them and anyway  Alfresco looks intuitive enough that they should be able to \"get it\" with gentle  nudges?  Would it be too cheeky to ask them?  It would probably help them to work at  documentation upstream, here.

Jean   Hi :) Thanks.  I might ask Ubuntu-Docs tomorrow although i have a feeling they might  not respond quickly anyway.  I thought ODFauthors was an alternative way that anyone could use to work on our  documentation and that which-ever system was used it would be wise for people to  say which docs they have worked on to keep the list informed?  So, i have  assumed that OOo people could \"get stuck in right away\" and then gradually get  used to Alfresco at their own pace?     My own feeling about non-English people writing documentation largely concurs  with Jean's except that i think it's friendlier and perhaps sexier sometimes  when there is a hint of foreign, exotic lands.  Even tho it seems to contradict  Jean's point I do also agree with someone else that said something about it  making it more difficult for later edits when people write in a language that is  not their 1st.  However there are many and frequent exceptions to that.  I think  the trick is to be more relaxed about those final edits and to sometimes let a  hint of 'foreign' magic slip through.  Later revisions are likely to smooth  those out anyway.     Regards from Tom :)  "

Certainly if someone is writing a draft, particularly of a more stand-alone document that isn't already in the Alfresco system, they could store it on ODFAuthors during development without confusing others. But people updating, reviewing and editing existing docs would need more coordination if they weren't all working on the same platform, and things could potentially get very confusing very quickly.   One possible scenario for anyone who seriously wants to stay on ODFAuthors is to ask someone to check out docs from Alfresco for them to work on and check those docs back in again when the work has been done. I've done that on occasion for people who have had difficulties with access to the ODFAuthors site; it's not ideal, but it works. Not that I am recommending that approach.  The ODFAuthors alternative is more viable for whole groups, such as the Spanish or German group, who choose to use that platform exclusively.  --Jean    "

Templates have some fundamental uses, too, that many people don't discover. For example, many MSWord users expect something similar to Word's normal.dot, and don't make the connection to using a self-defined default template. (Does Word 2007 still have normal.dot?)  Less specific to former Word users: Most people don't use paragraph styles, probably because they don't understand all the ways in which para styles can make their work easier... things like automatic tables of contents (using heading styles). For more advanced users, there is the feature for assigning any para style to an outline level.  All the cool things one can do with the Navigator.  Removing personal and other info before distributing a document.  Mail merge.  Page layout techniques: page styles, columns, frames, tables, sections. When to use which, plus usage tips.  For more advanced users: * Including chapter numbers in page, figure, and table numbers * Any \"gotchas\" with TOCs &amp; indexes when numbering by chapter * Various techniques for single-sourcing (creating >1 document from one ODT):    - Conditional text &amp; hidden text, paragraphs, sections   - Including sections   - Variables   Sound and video in Impress.  Cool stuff you can do with Draw. Several things in the Draw Guide could be made into articles, especially items from the Tips &amp; Tricks chapter.  More later!  --Jean   "

More thoughts, after discussions with people on the Website list as well as here:  * Host the blog on wordpress.com (which is where The Document Foundation's blog is located).  * Use the same theme as TDF's blog uses. This reinforces the brand as well as being easy to set up (no need for any graphics or much if any customisation). The theme can be changed at any time if we want to.  * Use the URL libo-docs.wordpress.com and the title LibreOffice Documentation Team blog. Title can be changed at any time.  * Set up 2 or 3 people as admins, so there's no drama if 1 or 2 of us are unavailable. Admins can make any necessary changes, but in particular they can set up other people to have Author or Editor access.  * As well as announcements, include tips, either short articles or pointers to longer articles or articles on other blogs.  Should I go ahead and set up a blog, or does someone else (who is also familiar with Wordpress) want to do that? Who, besides me, should be admins? David? Jeremy? others?  --Jean   "

I'm often not available or too busy to answer questions quickly.  The most helpful thing you can do, I think, is to work on rebranding the Impress Guide chapters.   This page has some info at the bottom summarising what needs to be done. http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development  It also has links to a slightly more detailed \"How to rebrand...\" document. You'll also need to refer to \"Producing LibreOffice User Guides\" (also linked from that wiki page), which should include details like where to get the template and how to apply it.  Jeremy (and others) should be able to answer questions about using Alfresco itself. Essentially all you need to do in Alfresco for rebranding is check out a chapter from the Impress Guide > Drafts space, download it (as part of the checkout process), do the work, then check it back in (uploading your changed copy as part of the checkin process) and leave it in Drafts.  As part of the rebranding process, you can (if you wish) check the contents against the program and update the chapter as necessary, including redoing screenshots if necessary (be sure to read the instructions in \"Producing LibreOffice User Guides\" about screenshots)... or you can leave that work to a later step, or you can leave comments in the file about things that need to be done (for example, mark any screenshot that shows \"OpenOffice.org\" in it.

While on the blog it would be no problem to use the main application icon (like this one: http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/File:Libo-list-icon.png), for iPads the question is a bit different:  We need to avoid some misinterpretations: 1) The icon does not open LibreOffice locally on the iPad. 2) The icon does not link to the official LibreOffice homepage. 3) The icon does not link to the main LibreOffice blog.  So the icon needs to identify the link target as - web based - being a blog - dedicated to the documentation team.  Adding some graphics inside the document symbol could interfere with the branding guidelines (http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Marketing/Branding), because the application icons is just a refined symbol from the logo.  For such a dedicated design it would be important to know the size of other icons on iPad, so we can include the possibility for more or less details our ideas and drafts.  Does anybody know about the size for standard iPad application icons?  Best regards  Bernhard     "

You bring up good points about being clear as to what the icon does. It would appear that the icons would be available only from the documentation blog. That should let the user know the icons link to the documentation blog only.  The requirements are for two images, one a cover image and one that as described, sounds like a splash screen. I quote from the wordpress.com iPad OnSwype section of the settings for the documentation blog, * \"Cover Logo -For best results use a 200200px transparent PNG  Launch Screen Image  Readers can add your site to their iPads home screen for quick access from an app-like icon.

She has the experience coming from the OpenOffice.org project. So for all the technical points and how to use the templates already available I defer to her.  As for writing in general, it isn't that hard. You talk to your friends, right? Well writing is just like talking to your friends. Talk to your friends, they are your audience. Type up your conversation as you are having it. Afterwards, when it is finished, go over it again. Correct the typos, spelling errors and grammar. Delete the expletives. Now ask yourself, \"Does it still make sense?; Does it still flow?; Does it sound like you?; Do you want your name associated with this?  That's writing. Marketing is another matter altogether. Marketing is knowing who you are speaking to.  I would prefer not to create assignments; you write about this, I'll write about that, and they can write about the other thing. If there is a part about LibreOffice that you use alot, a little thing that you had to figure out how to do that you may do differently in other office suites, write about that. Write about something that you do, that interests you. The good thing about blog posts is, they don't have to be long. A paragraph or two can suffice. OH, there I go again. Suffice, a perfectly good word but is it appropriate. Always keep an eye to marketing. We still haven't figured out our audience on the blog. We have few posts and only spam comments so far.  I agree it might be good to have blog posts listed in the social media. That is good but not good enough. The people that follow TheDocumentFoundation and LibreOffice on Twitter and Facebook are the choir. They already know about us and probably use LibreOffice. We need to get the word out to the general public. Post about our new blog posts on our own social media pages.

If there is an interest in maintaining a blog could we have a show of hands as to how many would be willing to help contribute to the blog?

Tags are less likely to be noticed by someone browsing the blog. And they really don't need to be predetermined for the blog authors since the keywords can be pretty specific to the article.  I will say, though, Lana's idea to showcase a tag cloud is definitely a good one. You never know what will catch someone's eye. If you do add a tag cloud, I advise against an animated cloud.

In many cases I read them and realise there is a topic in the user guides that could be repurposed into a tutorial with a bit of rewriting and usually the addition of an example or two. In fact, many topics in the user guides began life several years ago as answers to questions on the OOO forums.   3) I have a collection of tutorial type material that I've written, which has either been published on my own blog or in a book I've written, but which has never been placed on the OOo wiki.

I certainly would not like to see the blog use that method as a standard thing, but if the article is in ODT and is longish and has many pictures, then putting it into the blog is extra work (which, for me, won't get done). See my comments below about using the wiki publisher extension. I suspect the same problem would apply to the blog publisher, but I've never tried it. Have you used it for articles that contain graphics?   I have not used the wiki publisher extension to post directly to a wiki, mainly because all of the things I've done so far need manual cleanup after going through the wiki publisher. So I send the results from the wiki publisher to a text file, do the manual cleanup, and then paste the results into the wiki itself.

Join their team, say hi and ask for an \"Alfesco\" login from them. 2. Download their Draw guide from Alfresco &amp; let the list know you are working  on it so other people don't mess up what you are doing. 3. Post to  their mailing list about changes you are uncertain about or about  any other issues that seem relevant. 4. Upload back to the Alfresco site, hopefully moving it on to the next step,  perhaps to the proof-reading stage!  The list are helpful about this process  (it's amazingly easy apparently) 5. Let the list know you have uploaded it.   You might also be interested in other OpenSource programs, also free but more  importantly Free, such as Gimp and InkScape.  Gimp is a lot more like PhotoShop  and there a huge range of add-ons to add extra functionality.  It's not really  designed for vector graphics tho.  Inkscape is designed mainly for vector  graphics but it's not a pretty interface.  Hopefully Draw brings in useful  elements of both while keeping a nice looking interface.  http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/ http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/InstallHelp#Installing_on_a_Mac  OpenSource programs tend to work together very well and tend to be faster and  safer than proprietary equivalents.  Developments tend to be faster so if you  have a problem or can think of an improvement then it's usually worth letting  people know.

The main thing is  that i know now &amp; hopefully can help the next person better, faster. :) Regards from Tom :)     ________________________________ From: Jean Hollis Weber  To: documentation@libreoffice.org Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] Fw: [libreoffice-users] Libre Office -  Drawing    Hi Tom,  A correction: I'm not \"head of the documentation team\" (not even informally); I'm just coordinating some aspects (mainly the user guides) and tossing out ideas for others to (hopefully) run with.  And no reason you should really know about the printed books, as they are done by a third party, Friends of OpenDocument Inc. The publisher is actually me wearing a different hat, which some occasional help from others. The profits from sales are held by \"Friends of\" for the TDF community.  And I'm \"she\" (aka \"she who must be obeyed\" in some circles).  The links you provided are to the Getting Started chapter on Draw, not the Draw Guide itself, which (as you note) is on Alfresco. And when someone downloads a chapter to work on, they should \"check it out\" so others know it's being worked on even if they've missed a note sent to the list.   --Jean   "

I think a dedicated page is more likely to end-up as a redirect.     Please feel free to edit.  Note that camel-case words such as OpenSource or  LibreOffice need a ! before the word otherwise the documentation automatically  treats it as an internal-link which would probably go to a blank page.  If you  can't edit directly please let me know if you want changes.  It's not all pretty  but some of that is to be consistent with other pages in that section.     I need to add some links to the proper dedicated documentation you guys and  ladies are producing unless someone else beats me too it.

I agree with Jean-Francois that the black border and large black triangle should not be so emphatic or heavy.  Part of the problem is that this sort of thing doesn't scale.  As we go larger, we need to go finer.  I also don't think there is any need to bleed to the edge, if that is what was done.  A modest line (maybe 3mm) and smaller corner cut are appropriate.  (And consider making the larger cut corner not solid or else much lighter.)  Also, going to a greyed (lighter) tone is helpful, as is done on the LibreOffice splash/main display.   I also agree with Tom that the border and the corner cut could be the same colors as used for the different document types.  Finally, if the border just doesn't work at that scale (because of corner-cut proportions), maybe something more like the PDF cover page is needed, but using the theme and non-solid colors instead of the black symbol that is there now.   - Dennis E.

Today someone wrote to the Documentation list to say how awful the cover looks, particularly because of the black border. I agree. I'm not a graphic designer, and I didn't have the time to consult anyone else... but the time has now come to do so.  One idea I've had (and others expressed a similar idea) was to use the colour of the component's icon for the cover border colour. I think that would be an improvement, but a more attractive overall design would be an even greater improvement. Other ideas are being expressed on the Docs list.  So I turn to the Marketing team, and in particular the Art Team, for guidance and, I hope, a book cover design. I know that this will take some time, so the next book (Calc Guide) will use the original design, but with perhaps a different colour than black for the border.

Thus far we have documentation participants from OpenStack, Mozilla (several members of their docs team), Red Hat, Ubuntu, GNOME, FreeBSD, and Sourceforge.  I'm sure that those are groups you would have heard of, but there will be participants from other groups there, too. Some of them may not be open source projects, but they want to learn about documentation using open tools and community-based processes.  The primary benefit to the LibreOffice docs team is to interact with people who (1) use open tools to create documentation, and (2) make use of community contributions to build their documentation. It will be a chance to talk shop about tools, workflows, strategies, goals, etc.  We think that we can benefit through your involvement, too. We want to know what approaches you are taking with LibreOffice.  I know that the conference is just around the corner, but let me know if you have any questions.

We could cover all the distros simply by saying  \"LibreOffice can be installed using the distro's package manager.\"     For more advanced installs just covering Yum, Rpm, Deb &amp; tarballs covers almost  all distros.  Although there are about 600 distros they all tend to use the same  packages, the same package-managers and the same methods.

Being new, I thought that this might be a good place to get started but I wanted to make sure that I'm not going to be infringing on work that anyone else is doing with that guide. If anyone has any comments, concerns, objections, suggestions, etc. please let me know! Also, I'm interested in how long reviewing is generally expected to take, just so I have some reference, so if anyone wouldn't mind giving me just a rough estimate, it would be very much appreciated!  Thanks everyone! I'm very excited to be working on this with you all!  Chad  "

I don't know what the Steering Committee, TDF itself or any of the other guiding instances of the Foundation think either. The fact that there is a lot of Java stuff in there as the basic underpinning functionality does not plead in its favour, that is for sure, at least as far as I can tell from reading the dev lists, and comments I have seen on the dev irc.  At the moment there is no attributed Base specialist programmer/developer in the LibreOffice project. That is not to say that someone won't step up to the mark, but the question would then be, when, and if so, would he/she be able to revive/maintain the module ? The way things are going at the moment, the headlong rush with which things are proceeding in other modules will IMHO necessarily lead to more and more incidents with regard to the Base module.  A case in point is my personal conviction that recent changes to Calc threw up an unforeseen problem with the Oracle Report Builder extension which is bundled with LibreOfffice (the chart functionality in particular). I can not prove my theory, not being a programmer, and it seems that it is not so easy after all to find out which changes in the git repo caused things to become that way, but suffice it to say that the ORB worked fine without interfering with Calc charting in 3.3.2, and then suddenly started causing problems when 3.4 was in beta. In between, there was also the code merge from OOo, so of course, there is also the possibility that things in that merge messed up the inter-relationship between Calc charting and the ORB.   And finally, is it usable ? Yes, but...  - the connectors (postgres, mysql native) ought to be rebuilt with each new build (this is what Sun always did). This is currently not the case because these connectors are not considered core functionality and therefore not bundled with the extensions or integrated into the general code of the product ;  - mailmerge is, in the eyes of many \"former OOo users\" (myself included), unusable, and the priority to fix it keeps getting pushed back with each new release ;  - it suffers from various string, date, configuration settings and formatting issues ;   all of which lead to frustration for the end user. Personally, I am finding it harder and harder to recommend LibreOffice Base as a competent module, I tend to fall back to OOo 3.2.1 or, on the Mac, to NeoOffice, because I can live without the changes introduced into LibreOffice since its inception. However, I can understand that every user will have his or her own particular needs.   We desperately need a Base developer - if you happen to know one, it would be nice if he/she could spare some time to help out the project :-))   Alex   "

        "text": "  Chad, it's great to have you on the team. When someone is working on a chapter, they are supposed to check it out so it shows a \"working copy\" in the Drafts folder. Any chapter not checked out is available for someone to review.  Most chapters of the Impress Guide need in-depth reviewing for accuracy and usability. The main question at this point is: do the instructions (originally written for OOo Impress) work with LibreOffice Impress? Are there any features in LibO but not in OOo that are relevant to this chapter and need to be written about (bearing in mind that we don't try to cover everything). And even when things are complete and correct, the screenshots may be out of date.  How long is reviewing expected to take? That depends a lot on the chapter and how much work is involved in following the instructions to see if they work. My guess is a first pass through a typical chapter can take anywhere from 1 to 8 hours, perhaps more if a lot of recapturing and/or relabelling of screenshots is involved. BTW, if you are unable to redo pictures, that's okay; just flag the ones that need work and someone else will do them. Obviously, if you've only got an hour or two a day to work on this, then it could take a week to finish a chapter.   If life intervenes and it looks like you won't be able to finish within a week, please upload what you've done, even if you keep the file checked out, and let us know that you've been delayed. Or check it back in and say you're unable to finish it within a reasonable time. This happens to all of us.  I assume you've read the document on producing LibO user guides (found in Resources), which describes what to do or not do when reviewing, creating and inserting graphics, and so on.   --Jean     "

Anyway, I'll add it here:  The copyright and TOC pages are in sections controlled by a condition statement MD!=0 that picks up from the first paragraph in the ODM an invisible field named MD which is set to 1. This causes the section to be hidden. Sometimes it fails, for no reason I can see.  First thing to check: go into Tools > Options > LibreOffice Writer > Formatting Aids and make sure \"Hidden text\", \"Fields: Hidden text\" and \"Fields: Hidden paragraphs\" are all UNticked. I can't recall if there are any other options like that lurking somewhere.  BTW, I just opened the orginal ODM and updated all links, and the copyright and TOC pages are hidden as they should be.   The incorrect x-refs are scattered through the book; most x-refs are correct, but some are not. It's a thorough pain to find and fix the incorrect ones. I normally do this in the full-book ODT after unlinking (embedding) all the chapter files, because I've found that fixing them in the individual chapter files and then recompiling the book often doesn't work "

I haven't checked in with the website list for many  months but i would hazard a guess that they have been discussing this quite a  lot recently too.     Some things had to be set-up fast with the best foresight available at the  time.  Since then much has changed and grown.  Hindsight is fantastic, if only  we could have it much much earlier!!  Any links that don't work may need a tiny  bit of editing but i suspect that the 'global' bit in the middle wont appear on  old threads.     Part of the problem with Windows systems is that they religiously attempt to  stick with legacy systems that really need to be thrown out, for example the  registry.  As a result they have to put a lot of work into propping up systems  that are vulnerable and in constant danger of falling over.  Oddly, they also  help make Windows unable to run on older hardware because of the immense size of  all that legacy bloat.  By contrast Linux and OpenSource systems are not afraid  to throw something out when it becomes a burden and as a curious result there  are a lot of linux distros that run superbly fast on machines that haunt peoples  attics or contribute to landfill.

When you create a mst-file for the installation that file is controlling witch language is installed. You can set all other languages that Estonian to 0.  You can download the official exe-files and unpack them to you server. Half way through the installation process you should abort the installation (you only need to unpack - not to install). From there you can create the new mst-file. I quess you can use any software to run the actual installation. I have tried with Zenworks as well as simple batch/kix files.  Regarding upgrading, I think (but I don't know 100%) that you need to uninstall the current version and then install the new version afterward. Perhaps there is some parameter to overrule this. I don't know.   Best regards, Leif Lodahl    2011/5/26 Edmund Laugasson    "

Even if  various sources and training guides are consolidated then the documentation is  still likely to be very sparse compared to the other guides.  But people seem to  shy away from relational databases or have put so much work into the one they  have that switching to a different one is much more difficult.     By contrast a lot of people seem to be trying Impress and asking questions about  it.  So, Base is less urgent imo and probably needs people that have a lot of  experience with it to try getting something together for it first.

On a Virtual Machine such as VirtualBox, inside your OS 2.  Run Ubuntu as a boot-cd, linux user would say \"Live Cd\".  Ubuntu 10.04 and  onwards tend to be a bit awkward but it might be worth a try.    3.  Install Ubuntu as a dual-boot alongside your current OS  I can help you with 3 (or 1 or 2).  For 1 it would help to know which OS you  mostly use.     However, if you are only doing this for the screen-shots then it might be a  better idea to leave the screen-shots to someone else and just let people know  which shots need to be replaced.  There are already a few people doing it that  way.  I think even people that do the screenshots and the rest tend to do the  screenshots in a separate session, perhaps getting a batch of 2 or 3 screenshots  (perhaps more) and then doing more editing.  The work-flow seems better that way  i think?

It's usually around the top of the  keyboard between the Enter key and the number-pad.  It tends to default to  saving the screenshot as a png on your desktop or perhaps in Ubuntu's Pictures  folder.  From the top taskbar click on Places - Pictures  There is a slightly better tool, again from the top taskbar Applications - Accessories - Snapshot (i think) It allows you to set a time-delay and stuff.  There was a discussion about  better tools ages ago but i can't remember the result.     If you want to edit the picture in Ubuntu then you might want to install Gimp System - Administration - Synaptic Package Manager and then either tool to search for gimp.  In Ubuntu 11.04 the menus might be very different unless it reverts to \"Gnome\"  or \"Classic\" desktop rather than the all 'new' Unity.

If anyone particularly wants to do screenshots, those books would greatly benefit.  So although Impress is the book most in need of work right now, the work needed includes much more than screenshots. It absolutely needs to be checked to se if the info is correct for LibreOffice and no important LibO items (that are not in OOo) have been left out.

That's probably a rationalisation, but as an excuse for not limiting too much the number of volunteers who can do screenshots we can use, I think it's a good excuse. ;-)   My only real concern is that colors not obscure the text on the screenshot and that they print well. Some themes do a reverse color for selections that makes the item very difficult to read in a screenshot.   AFAIK we at LibO haven't actual set a specific theme and style. My suggestion was for something that would look similar on most common o/s, but it was never agreed on. Neither has any other proposal been agreed on. Sometimes I get the impression from a few people that they think the LibO Docs team should do things differently from OOo just because it's different, even when the method has worked well for the OOo Docs team.

The idea is to get help with the development of workflows for the docs team, and - hopefully - bring back life to the currently-dormant OOo Alfresco plugin [1], which could be very valuable as a collaboration tool if we can get it to an operational state with recent versions of LibreOffice.

Jean just explained the following problems: \"The Getting Started guide desperately needs to have a great many pix replaced. Many are from Windows (done by Ron [Faile] before the decision to not use [screenshots from] Windows), and many more still say OOo on them.\"  So, basically, this job would involve going through each chapter of the Getting Started guide and replacing the screenshots in accordance with the LibO Style Guide at http://alfresco.libreoffice.org, under Company Home > (en) English [English] Content > Resources  This would be a much-appreciated contribution if your schedule so allows...

Basically, this job would involve going through each chapter of the Writer guide and replacing the screenshots in accordance with the LibO Style Guide at http://alfresco.libreoffice.org, under Company Home > (en) English [English] Content > Resources, but using screenshots taken under Ubuntu/Fedora Linux.

The 'new' people that they are trying to gift the code to is a  charitable organisation called Apache.  Apache are on far better terms with us  than Oracle were so it has all become less critical.     However, we are now becoming more competitive with MS Office which is a major  \"money spinner\" for MS.  So, we can expect MS to chase us in various ways as  soon as they see us as a threat or possibly even before.  So, it's possibly  imminent and hefty so it's critical that we take away any opportunities for them  to fight us.  Replacing screen-shots taken in Windows is a critical issue.

So, LO will increasingly be  seen as 'upstream' and the best place to work on stuff.  To modify it for  downstream just rename a chapter &amp; delete sections on functionality they don't  have.     TDF are unlikely to chase people through legal action over a few screen-shots   or LO or TDF branding appearing  in other people's documentation.  In a way it  would be free advertising.     I guess that to help ODFauthors with future releases of LibreOffice  Documentation a lot of re-working sentences could be done to avoid words that  are specific to LO.  It's an impossible task for this release though.  There is  an opportunity for ODFauthors to promote themselves as a group worth paying (or  resourcing) to produce documentation for various projects such as KOffice,  AbiWord&amp;Gnumeric as well as OpenOffice.

I think the Euros problem is likely to be a rounding error if the 9.87 and/or  the 6.54 are the results of calculations.  It is possible to bracket  calculations and use functions such as \"Round\" to round-off extra digits rather  than just using formatting to hide them.  Often the \"Round\" functions tend to  drop numbers such as 9.869 to 9.860, well 9.86 so it's wise to test it and then  maybe add 0.005 before rounding-off.  For example =SUM(D6:D8)/3 would become  =ROUND((SUM(D6:D8))+0.005)  There probably is an agreed standard to the way particular functions such as  that are handled but proprietary products tend to break such agreements and then  keep that secret so that people are confused when the standards are adhered to,  hence various arguments in this mailing-list.  OpenSource products can have  errors and mob-rule can over-ride most things but at least they don't try to  hide it either way even if it hurts them.  So, it's worth checking by testing  before relying on results.

One advantage of the blog is that with tags and categories, it is easy to search and a lot of ordinary users are familiar with searching blogs.  With the blog, one person can write a draft and others with blog access can review or edit it before publication.

        "text": "Hi :)  Regina, this is not a criticism of you but just some of my anger at the world  that gave me a fairly decent education in sciences and maths and made me  practically unemployable as a result.   Ok, again  -3 x -3 = 9  I think people tend to expect the - to make the result -9.  Perhaps they expect  the result to be the same as -(3^2) which is a completely different thing.   Again this is more about people lack of maths understanding than about  spreadsheets.  An evening course or on-line course about maths is the answer,  not documentation for a spreadsheet program.     In the bug-report the first comment complains that spreadsheet programs stick to   internationally agreed maths standard for the order in which to apply functions,   Bodmas (stands for \"Brackets, of/division, multiplication, add, subtract\").   Choosing a non-standards order makes higher functions exponentially difficult or   even impossible.  Before the 0 was borrowed from Arabic notation simple  multiplication and division was only possible by people with a university degree   level of maths skills.  Choosing to go against Bodmas would be similarly  catastrophic.  Business users like to left align numbers which makes simple addition more  difficult at a glance, for example  34  300 ====== 640  ?!!?  Maths people and accountants tend to shudder at left aligned numbers, or realise   they are likely to make a lot of cash from these people.  A right-justified list   makes it much more obvious    34 300 ===== 334 in a much more obvious way.  Ok, its a stupid example with only 2 numbers  in the list but imagine with a LOT more numbers in the list, say 20 to 30 per  page.     Back to the expected result of -9.  What is the square root? -3 x 3 is not  really right.  In fact we are now getting towards 2 dimensional numbers such as  \"imaginary numbers\" and perhaps even getting close to chaos theory and fractal  dimensions.     In the bug-report the first post shows a stunning lack of understanding about  maths, roughly along the lines of demanding that the spreadsheet program should  give 640 in my example of adding numbers.     \" I definitly see this as a bug and confirm it. Here's what I did:  1: Input \"=-3^2+4\" into a spreadsheet cell, result is 13 2: Input \"=4-3^2\" into another cell, result is -5 3: Input \"=-(3^2)+4\" into a third cell, result is -5  The problem here seems to be that the program attaches the negative sign to the 3 in step one before doing the square, which it should not, unless manipulated by parentheses like this: \"(-3)^2\".  \"  In 1 the result is 13 because the first function done is -3 x -3 = 9, and then  add the 4 to give 13 In 2 the result is due to an ambiguity that is normally resolved by using the  standards method of afaik 3 x 3 = 9, and then 4 - 9 = -5  People with maths  skills generally realise there is a potential problem with the ambiguity here  and might try fixing it by using brackets eg = 4 + (-3^2) which gives us 13  'obviously' since the inside of the bracket is done before applying the stuff  outside the brackets.    In 3 the result is -5 because the bracketed stuff is done first giving us +9  again, then outside the bracket that is made -+9 = -9 and then the 4 is added as  expected.     This is maths, not spreadsheet stuff, unless i made a mistake in how #2 should  be treated according to the Bodmas standards (in which case the bug-report needs  to be fixed asap) but afaik i'm right.  Even if i am wrong this is not really a  job for documentation except as a brief note that 'common-sense' sometimes  over-rides Bodmas but will hopefully be fixed soon.

At the moment, if you want to translate on the wiki, you have to have 2 windows open, the first with the original language wiki page, and the second, a new wiki page on the English part of the site. For me, quite frankly, this is too much of an effort when the underlying system already has the capability to link translations automatically to the underlying original document. I don't like wikis in general anyway because they tend to end up having stuff all over the place, improperly indexed or categorized and it just seems to be a free-for-all. The wiki was set up knowingly with an extremely open approach to encourage contribution, but the downside of this free ranging management is that anyone can contribute anything and put it anywhere they more or less want, and name it in more or less anyway they want to. So much for having a cohesive, easy to search, easy to update, and easy to maintain information system. Trying to find out whether something has been updated, or even if it already exists, requires a lot of effort on the part of those who are conscientious enough not to want to waste their time writing something that has already been done or something similar.  I can translate from German to English, French to English and back again no problem, but I will not trawl the wiki in search of things that \"need translating\" from one to the other.  Alex    "

This  wiki serves - according to its main page - many needs simultaneously[1,  see below], but at present in my eyes mainly for project coordination.  (B) By \"libreofficewiki\" I thought of http://www.libreofficewiki.de,  which is just an alias for the old http://www.ooowiki.de - a very good  source of specific information bits and Howtos about OpenOffice.org (but  only in German language).  (C) I don't know of other public dedicated wikis at present. However,  there are libreoffice wiki sections in e.g. the German Ubuntu Wiki [2]  and probably other, non-LibO Wikis of course.   (D) Finally, to complete the list, the wiki on  http://help.libreoffice.org is not a public (i.e. community writable)  wiki at the moment, it is just the wikified content of the online help  from the LibO software. But it is sometimes referred to as LibO Wiki as  well.  So what I've suggested to do is setting up libreofficewiki.de (see B) as  multilanguage version and translate the contents (I'd suggest starting  with English and then followed by other languages)  Out of usability reasons I'd not suggest to put such little bits of end  user information into the TDF wiki (A). At least not at present.   In times of OOo, the argumentation for using the wiki was different:  They suggested to put as much as possible information into the OOo Wiki  (here I mean: wiki.services.ooo..., not ooowiki.de) to make it the  biggest and best possible all-purpose knowledge base. Which is a good  argument, of course, but the problem is that for not-so-advanced users  there is too much information so the average user does get too much  search results and does not know where to start. All-in-one is only good  for advanced people, and if it can be filtered efficiently (e.g. show  results in one or a desired set of languages only).

It should have remained at least 3.4.0rc2 until there was time to discover what regressions and show-stoppers had arisen.  The need for a 3.4 release celebration was not justifiable under any circumstances.  This regression business is very discouraging.)  -----Original Message---"

Die Auswahl erfolgt nach Browser-Einstellungen oder - bei angemeldeten Benutzern - ber die Einstellungen im Profil.  Damit die einzelnen Seiten (topics) aber bei Namensgleichheit nicht in Konflikt zueinander geraten, knnte man das Wiki z.B. so umorganisieren:  de.libreofficewiki.de en.libreofficewiki.de ...  Technisch gesehen wren das dann zwar getrennte Wikis, aber man kann natrlich fr eine Verlinkung verwandter Themen untereinander sorgen und auch ein einheitliches Erscheinungsbild (Logo, Name usw.) schaffen.  Diese Verlinkung kann aber nur dann automatisch geschehen, wenn die jeweiligen Seiten in den unterschiedlichen Sprachversionen den selben Namen haben. In der Praxis heit dies, eine automatische Verlinkung wre nur bei Seiten zu Eigennamen wie \"LibreOffice\" oder \"OpenDocument\" mglich, bei allen anderen wre eine Verlinkung Handarbeit (was sich aber nicht wesentlich von der Lage z.B. bei MediaWiki unterscheidet).  Wichtig ist natrlich, dass es ausreichend Beteiligung gibt, d.h. dass das neue Wiki dann auch mit Inhalten gefllt wird. In diesem Zusammenhang sollte man sich auch Gedanken ber die Lizenz machen: Der deutschsprachige \"Altbestand\" ist unter GFDL lizenziert. TDF/LO hat sich jedoch fr eine CC-Lizenz entschieden. Fr ein englischsprachiges Wiki knnte man sich also entscheiden fr GFDL, CC oder GFDL+CC (oder etwas ganz anderes).  Natrlich msste man fr das neue Wiki auch noch ein neues Logo entwerfen und dieses von der TDF absegnen lassen, da die allgemeinen Regeln fr die Verwendung des Namens \"LibreOffice\" und des Logos eine Lsung hnlich wie die fr das alte OpenOffice.org-Wiki nicht decken.  Ansonsten liee sich die hier angerissene Lsung in relativ kurzer Zeit realisieren, d.h. innerhalb von ungefhr einem Tag bis einer Woche. Was die Ressourcen anbelangt, so ist der Betrieb dank der grozgigen Untersttzung durch WikiWikiWeb.de und Freies Office Deutschland e.V. bereits bis Mai 2013 gesichert. Wenn man Anderes/Besseres wollte, msste man das jetzt klar formulieren, um weitere Mglichkeiten auszuloten.   Kind regards Regina  Regina Henschel schrieb:   "

I'm trying to translate Martin's main points and to add my comments.  Maybe you can forward this posting to Martin, I don't know if he is  subscribed here.    His point here is, that the GUI is already international (with browser  detection).   Nice - but it does not help to have an English Wiki GUI if the Content  is German ;-)    The idea is to keep the different Language versions in separate Wikis.  That's fine, I'd say. We should go for it, or better \"Martin, please do  it\" ;-)  Maybe a domain like libreofficewiki.org could better serve the i18n  idea?     The look&amp;feel of each language wiki should be adapted.  Ok :-)    Automatic interlinking works only for identical Page Titles.  My suggestion would be to go for manual interlinking first but to keep  the possibility open to switch to automatic interlinking later or - if  possible - for a certain section of the Wiki. I.e. if the different  languages have completely different content, there is no need for  automatic linking. But if the amount of direct translations rises,  automation can help a lot.     Heavy contribution is desired :-)  (Aggreed)   Licensing question should be solved.   (What is the best Licence for LibO documentation? I'm not an expert  here.)     Logo + Theme should be negotiated with TDF.   (Who can do this? Martin?)    The above solution could be realized in short time and the server  hosting is granted for the next two years.   I'd say, this is a good starting point for English/international Tips &amp;  Tricks or similar collections. But nobody can know if it will be  accepted and filled by the community. But it's good to offer this  possibility. After a year or two, we will know better.  Apropos, when set up, maybe the internationalisation of  libreofficewiki.de should be announced on the website and i18n lists?   Nino  "

At the moment some of those guides are not fully updated.  I'm reasonably sure  the Writer and Calc guides are done for this edition.  I think the \"Introducing  LibreOffice\" guides has got some new updates going through in the next few  days.  Similarly with the Impress guides.  Base is likely to take a long time.   I think work on Math and Draw are about to start (hopefully).     If you sign-up to the Documentation Team's mailing list and ask them you might  get a better answer to all of these things.  They are quite friendly.     The Documentation Team are likely to appreciate it more if you are able to get  involved with writing/updating the English (US) guides and/or get involved with  translating them into 'local' languages that are likely to be understood in  schools/colleges in your area.

And its for* free of charge*.  At the moment I am thinking about the way I could increase the knowledge/support about LibreOffice within my community.  There is a high possibility if the Document Foundation and LibreOffice Documentation Team allow us to print this book locally and and redistribute for free of charge among the schools and relevant places like public libraries.  As you may know Sri Lanka is a* developing country*. So, the cost of this book is not affordable to many people.  What I am planning is to write to the \"President's Task Force for the English and ICT\" and relevant organizations like Ministry of Education, ICT Agency of Sri Lanka, and National Institute of Education, etc by requesting arranging necessary for local printing and distribution of more this book.  They could find funds from the local or international sponsors.  I would like to here a positive response from TDF and documentation team before I write to above mention organizations.  I hope we could print and distribute more than 10,000 copies of this book.

Hello list,   Quite recently, I had a discussion with one of the system administrators here at  our university campus.  The discussion was about installing LibreOffice by  default on all new desktop PC's for personnel.  Apparently, the item has been discussed in an internal meeting, but one of the  reasons why our sysadmins prefer to stick with Microsoft Office is that it seems  to allow easy remote managament of Office installations.  For example (I'm  quoting our sysadmin here...):  * Group Policies in Active Directory allow to change certain security settings. * Windows Server Update Services allows an easy remote installation of updates  on all the desktop PC's of the personnel.  My question to this list is about the LibreOffice alternatives for this.  Does  LibreOffice have possibilities of remote administration and management?  Does it  allow a sysadmin to easily and remotely manage security and updates from one  central location?  Any help or pointers to websites where this is explained are more than welcome!

What do others think about the contrast?  Other than that issue, I find only a few problems.  Figure 4 (Special Characters dialog box) has the upper left-hand \"character\" selected, but that character is blank, so both places on the dialog box that show the selected chracter are blank. Most of the shots in this chapter are fine in terms of content, although I think the ones on fonts should probably have one of tne \"Liberation\" fonts selected, not \"Bitstream Charter\".  The labels on Figure 22 (The Table Toolbar) have numbers that are much too large in comparison to the text around them, and the arrows are much too heavy. (The numbers on the original picture are also too large.)  BTW, the note in the instructions about the recommended maximum width of screenshots is out of date and I will change or remove it.

Jeff is going to give me some mentoring, and I am going to get started with the practical implementation work as regards configuring/customizing our LibreOffice Alfresco platform. If someone else wants to give practical help with this, they are most welcome at any time.  Jeff is also setting-up an online meeting with the developer of the currently-dormant OOo plugin for Alfresco so that we can explore how to update it and get it operationally working with our current LibreOffice version. This is scheduled to take place during the week of June 27. Depending on how this initiative develops, we might possibly be able to envision integrating it into a workflow for the English docs team. I'm going to post on our LibreOffice devs list and discuss the project there, too.  So the first practical step will be to establish with the English docs team exactly what our needs and expectations are. Looking back at past threads on this list, I guess we can already list the following:  * configure user groups with properly-configured powers;  * develop informative e-mail alerts for added/removed/edited content;  * develop automated workflows for the English docs team (which could be subsequently replicated for other language projects to manage their own docs work, if they express interest). In connection with this, we'd need to establish whether docs team contributors prefer the \"classic\" Alfresco interface exposed at http://alfresco.libreoffice.org or the newer, revised heavily-Ajax-powered powered Alfresco interface exposed at http://documentation.libreoffice.org, or whether both should be available simultaneously, as at present;  * develop a special world-facing site on documentation.libreoffice.org and/or media.libreoffice.org to be a showcase and download point for the platform's content for our end users;  * optionally, depending on how things pan out, configure our Alfresco platform to properly function with the OOo/LibreOffice plugin for Alfresco, and integrate that functionality into the EngDocs workflow.  Please could I hear your comments and suggestions about the above? Once we get some kind of requirements spec figured out, the actual practical work can start ASAP.  "

        "text": "Hi Everybody:  What platform are you running LibO on?  Personally I use it most of the time on Win XP on 3 machines of different hardware and sizes, and on a network with 4Tb. of stuff on a D-Link DNS-323 NAS.  (Note: Since the DNS-323 is a Unix box and the drives are formatted ext3, Icons attached to anything by the user will lose their links to the associated .ICO files, but the rest is OK and has certain advantages. Other than that XP will see these drives as if they were NTFS.)  Other than that, recently in the updates for Fedora 13 on my laptop, I received a link that updated the whole platform to Fedora 15 (i386). This comes with LibO.  However the behavior of LibO or any other application can vary somewhat from one platform to another, depending on what hardware and drivers may be implicated.  Nonetheless that, and my main machine which can boot either XP or Fedora 14 x-86_64 can share the data and work with it back and forth.  For the .ODG format (LibO draw), I have a lot of my own resources prepared in the background to deal with a very diverse set of topics.  I can also import both bitmap and some vectorial data from Gimp, although importing vectorial data from other resources has its caveats, and that data may require a double import through Inkscape or may require reformatting, such as breaking up a metafile, or even converting the data to a metafile, breaking it, then bringing it back into true .ODG drawing objects and hierarchically regrouping and/or combining.  In this way I also have imported a lot of stuff originally done in DOS in Generic CADD 6, then exported as .DXF release 11, and imported into .ODG. Drawing by drawing the results differ greatly. Some drawings are easily imported, others can take hours to clean up.  I also keep an extensive collection of my own support files on every topic under the sun, not only computer hardware and software, but electronics, instrumentation, communication services, electronics and more. Currently the support collection shows at about 6.3 Gb.  In the case of writer, I also have a bunch of my own templates, one of which is particularly useful and versatile as to the range of subjects of the intended contents.  Since hyperlinks and sections do not export readily to Word, files made with this template are better exported to .PDF for recipients who do not use LibO, Oo, or Abiword. The hyperlinks can be exported if the exporting module is properly set up to do this. I would also recommend using tagged .PDFs, especially if they have to be read on mobile devices such as those using Win CE (now Windows mobile 5 or 6.)  Attributes relating to Hierarchically bulleted or numbered lists are file specific, and a selection of extra facilities of this type are also embedded in this template, which is also Language coded for Canadian English.  (Any part of the text in an .ODT can be separately coded for a different language, and often needs to be preset before entering text in other languages to avoid unnecessary cleanup of text details that are language specific.)

        "text": "Hi :) I think a lot of people are running it on Ubuntu using the Ubuntu Xp Silver  theme, at least for producing screen-shots.     Marc was looking for a similar theme for Mageia so he might be able to help find  a good one for Fedora, or maybe have an idea of where to look if you are stuck.   There are legal reasons for not having screen-shots done in Windows so i think  some people are just leaving the screenshots for those people that are using a  suitable platform and theme.     I use Ubuntu 10.04 at home and most of the machines at work now have that too as  a dual-boot.  There are a couple of machines there with Ubuntu 10.10.  I've just  managed to get my boss to agree to having LibreOffice installed on the Windows  Xp side of the dual-boots :)   Most people still use Xp and just complain about  how slow it is rather than trying Ubuntu but at least it's an option now.     Regards from Tom :)      ________________________________ From: Bruce_Martin  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] 3.4 bug?  Hi Everybody:  What platform are you running LibO on?  Personally I use it most of the time on Win XP on 3 machines of different  hardware and sizes, and on a network with 4Tb. of stuff on a D-Link DNS-323 NAS.  (Note: Since the DNS-323 is a Unix box and the drives are formatted ext3, Icons  attached to anything by the user will lose their links to the associated .ICO  files, but the rest is OK and has certain advantages. Other than that XP will  see these drives as if they were NTFS.)  Other than that, recently in the updates for Fedora 13 on my laptop, I received  a link that updated the whole platform to Fedora 15 (i386). This comes with  LibO.  However the behavior of LibO or any other application can vary somewhat from one  platform to another, depending on what hardware and drivers may be implicated.  Nonetheless that, and my main machine which can boot either XP or Fedora 14  x-86_64 can share the data and work with it back and forth.  For the .ODG format (LibO draw), I have a lot of my own resources prepared in  the background to deal with a very diverse set of topics.  I can also import both bitmap and some vectorial data from Gimp, although  importing vectorial data from other resources has its caveats, and that data may  require a double import through Inkscape or may require reformatting, such as  breaking up a metafile, or even converting the data to a metafile, breaking it,  then bringing it back into true .ODG drawing objects and hierarchically  regrouping and/or combining.  In this way I also have imported a lot of stuff originally done in DOS in  Generic CADD 6, then exported as .DXF release 11, and imported into .ODG.  Drawing by drawing the results differ greatly. Some drawings are easily  imported, others can take hours to clean up.  I also keep an extensive collection of my own support files on every topic under  the sun, not only computer hardware and software, but electronics,  instrumentation, communication services, electronics and more. Currently the  support collection shows at about 6.3 Gb.  In the case of writer, I also have a bunch of my own templates, one of which is  particularly useful and versatile as to the range of subjects of the intended  contents.  Since hyperlinks and sections do not export readily to Word, files made with  this template are better exported to .PDF for recipients who do not use LibO,  Oo, or Abiword. The hyperlinks can be exported if the exporting module is  properly set up to do this. I would also recommend using tagged .PDFs,  especially if they have to be read on mobile devices such as those using Win CE  (now Windows mobile 5 or 6.)  Attributes relating to Hierarchically bulleted or numbered lists are file  specific, and a selection of extra facilities of this type are also embedded in  this template, which is also Language coded for Canadian English.  (Any part of the text in an .ODT can be separately coded for a different  language, and often needs to be preset before entering text in other languages  to avoid unnecessary cleanup of text details that are language specific.)  Likewise, I have collected an independent archive of about 1600 fonts which is  backed up in multiple places. (I would not want to load all that in one system,  as it would burden the system excessively)  For use with RTL or multi-byte languages, this will depend on adequate support  from the levels of the Operating system that will provide the necessary  underpinnings.

This is a good example of the occasional differences between the LibO supplied with Ubuntu (and possibly other Linux distros) and the LibO installed from the LibO website. Also, at various times that selection was not available in the Linux version of OOo, so it's possible that it's not there even in the original LibO version.  Hmmm... another thought: on the General page, is \"Enable experimental (unstable) features\" selected? I don't know if that makes any difference in this case, but I've found that a lot of things that appear to be missing suddenly show up when I select that option.  We've handled these o/s differences in the past by using a screenshot from Windows and noting in the text that it's not found on all operating systems, or may be worded differently. An alternative would be to use a Linux screenshot (which I can provide) but include that item in the text with something like \"not found on all operating systems; called 'Load LibreOffice during system start-up' on Windows\".

Wine is another of those amusing regressive acronyms favoured by devs.  It  stands for \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\" indicating that it is similar to an  emulator but uses a different technique.  In this case by running Windows  applications at the same level as native programs rather than by introducing an  extra couple of layers between the code and the \"bare metal\" of the machine.  I  don't know how the APIs are developed to do that but it's all very clever.   Apparently Wine can also be used on Macs to run Windows programs there too.   It's not always easy to use but programs run very much faster than normal  emulators and in some cases faster than a fresh install on a fresh install of  Windows!     My neighbour is VERY into Wine and keeps on going on about it.  I try to pretend  i'm out sometimes if he knocks.  All good :) Regards from Tom :)     ________________________________ From: Jaimon Jacob  To: \"documentation@global.libreoffice.org\"   Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] Libreoffice 3.4 Quickstarter Problem  I installed Libreoffice 3.3 through Wine, and there it is... the Quickstarter  option.

The closest to code are schemas (in Relax NG in the case of ODF) for the XML structures that carry the ODF document representation.  The specifications do require expertise, but the intention is that someone \"skilled in the art\" could independently produce a conforming implementation without having to look at any code of an implementation.  (That's the ideal; I think it is safe to say that the ODF specification is still a bit immature in that respect.  It will improve over time.)  Programmers might or might not be inclined to do what it takes to digest one of these applications and provide QA and clarifying text improvements.  Fewer seem inclined to engage in the task of creating such specifications.  While the first-line of users are adopters of specifications in implementations, it is desirable to have participation of others, just as it is important at Apache and TDF.  It is just that the bug reports are not about implementations, but questions and comments on a specification.  People here who participate in the OASIS OpenDocument TC include Regina Henschel, who has been diligent in reviewing and questioning definitions of spreadsheet functions in ODF, and Thorsten Behrens, who does bring a strong implementer perspective.  Charles Schulz of TDF is on the OASIS Board.  There may be others but I've recognized these three in recent contributions on this list.   - Dennis  PS: I'll wager that the ODF specifications themselves have not been a topic of discussion among ODFAuthors.

Some settings and configs get  over-written .  It can repair a partial or failed install (or upgrade).     If you try a straight install  of Ubuntu onto the same partitions, when you get  to the \"Partitioning Section\" (about 7th or 8th page i think) choose the  \"Advanced\" / \"Manual\" or now \"Something different\" option then you can choose  the Mount Points.  Make sure the column \"Format?\" has no ticks in it.   Afterwards the   /home/user folder gives a good indication of some of the programs that had been installed  so just open Synaptic to reinstall them :)  Reformatting will obviously wipe anything on the partition so just make sure the  partitions don't get formatted.  One thing i found amazing about this was a multi-tabs firefox session that i  killed in one release using 1 edition of Firefox successfully re-opened all the  right tabs in a different release of both Ubuntu and firefox!

My appearance here has been urged upon me by Tom Davies, and I'll have to trust his wisdom on this, as I'm no expert. I do, however, keep copious notes on most things I learn about new software, and have years of work with MS Access, developing databases for my own use.  Right now, as I get the time, I'm accumulating everything I can find that looks like documentation for Base, while also rushing to get several databases up and running. I find Base is pleasantly stable, full of features, and not exactly well documentated. It's also slower than I expected, even with indexes in place (but maybe I'm messing something up, being new to this software). But it's a great piece of work, and I expect to be working with it for many years ahead.  I write a lot, and I'm very willing to contribute documentation, or at least drafts for others to tune up as needed. I know I have much to learn, but I'm on track with learning it, so...  I'm open to any suggestions as to where I need to go to learn how to be a better documentation contributor.  Thanks for your patience while I learn the ropes.

Anything you post is done as an individual, surely?

Friends of has an account with Lulu.com; ODFAuthors does not.

It would  seem that it would be dumb not to.  My questions were to gauge how tightly  integrated ODFauthors is with TDF and whether it might be appropriate to help  them gain membership, perhaps at a reduced rate or as part of TDF.     All the answers in this thread indicate that there wouldn't be much point and  that ODFauthors could pursue this separately if there was any point.     The gravitas of an organisation can increase when it can show that it is members  of or supported by or just working with other relevant organisations.  Almost  like a quality mark.  But it sounds as though that would be the only benefit to  ODFauthors and for the price-tag it wouldn't be worth it.     I've learned a lot about ODFauthors and it's all good :) Regards from Tom :)     ________________________________ From: Dennis E. Hamilton  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org Subject: RE: [libreoffice-documentation] ODFauthors  Tom,  I am not clear what the question is.  If ODFAuthors is not a genuine organization, I don't think there is any way for  it to join OASIS.     The easiest path would be for interested individuals from ODFAuthors to become  TDF Members and be associated to whatever degree OASIS/TDF require to offer them  as participants on OASIS Technical Committees.  I can't speak for the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), but I suspect they have  no need to support participation on OASIS.  That is to say, I would be surprised  to learn that they are an institutional member or see any need to become one.   Perhaps that will change as the incubator process is completed for  OpenOffice.org, but I think it is outside the lines with regard to how Apache  operates.  I can't imagine them funding a third-party to go play at OASIS under  any conditions.  That's completely outside the box, it seems to me.  - Dennis  PS: The last time I checked, ODFAuthors was about ODF in name only. PPS: I just checked on the OASIS site.  ASF is not a member of OASIS at any  level.     -----Original Message---"

The PDFs are primarily for the many people who want to print pages for reference, and for those people who need an offline manual, something they can store on their computer for use when they are not connected to the internet. PDFs are also good for people who have not yet installed LibreOffice or OOo or who might need to look up something on a machine that doesn't have LibO or OOo on it.  HTML is great for people who prefer to read stuff online and are able to do so when they want the info.  I do not think ODT is suitable for most users as a reference document, though it is fine for many and of course necessary if one wants to edit the file. Inexperienced users can bugger up an ODT faster than you can say \"don't do that!\" But they can't easily change a PDF, and they are more likely to already know how to open and read a PDF than an ODT.  A personal example of use: While I was travelling with my iPad as my only computer, I could easily store and read PDFs on it, or download them when needed (when I could find a connection), but ODTs were inconvenient. I eventually found a program that would open them (by converting to something, HTML probably) but there were no pages and some of the formatting was a bit messed up. If I needed or wanted to answer a question for someone (as I did on a few occasions), it was a hassle that PDFs avoid. When I had an internet connection, I could have looked up something on a wiki or a website, but usually I was working offline.  I may be unusual in my working conditions, but really this is not a \"one size fits all\" situation.  Errrr.... didn't mean to have that turn into a rant, but it did. ;-)  --Jean        "

So, you would have to employ something else for formatting purposes, much like CSS formats XHTML code.  In the (XML) structured world using Adobe FrameMaker, you could run FrameMaker in its structured mode using a DTD file for the XML structure and an EDD file (that a template designer must create) for formatting purposes. The EDD file would typically be imported into an FrameMaker FM file template after it had been previously structured via a DTD file, the end result is a template file that an author could then utilize for authoring purposes, utilizing whatever formatting the EDD file was programmed to provide. Not an easy task--the creation of a formatting EDD.  OOo really never did much with its so-called DocBook XML. In fact, what little it had was for the DocBook version 4.1.2, which dates back to 18 Dec 2003.  BTW, I have created EDDs based upon DocBook 4.5 and DocBook 5.x, which were generated by FrameMaker from the DocBook DTDs. Generation of formatted DocBook-XML templates for documentation-authoring purposes is typically a job for an expert, so doing documentation with DocBook is definitely not for beginners. If anybody would care for some advice using FrameMaker's DocBook 4.5 or 5.x, I could give it.  There are other software applications that could be used.

My view, which I have expressed on several occasions: Using DocBook files (or anything other than ODT files) as source documents for our user guides would be counter-productive, for two main reasons:  (1) It would exclude the vast majority of potential contributors to the LibO documentation, who won't want to have to obtain and learn to use a new tool; most contributors, in my experience, have enough difficulty learning how to use Writer well.  (2) Keeping our source docs in anything other than ODTs created using our own product is very, very bad publicity for our product.  Related reasons are: by using the product to produce documentation, our contributors are more likely to learn how to use that product better; and they may find bugs or identify places where the product could be enhanced, thus assisting the developers.  I'm fine with discussing tools for producing multiple outputs (HTML, for example) from our source ODT files. Individual members of the team who are familiar with those tools can work from the source ODTs, but most contributors would not need to use or understand them.   Some other forms of user docs can be produced, delivered, and maintained on the wiki: things like tips and short how-tos. But not the user guides. Seriously.  --Jean   "

Somebody has to create a formatting file and also a template based upon the marriage between DTD and the formatting file. It is not an easy, straightforward task.  Doing some small DocBook (XML) programming and formatting with very simple files would help one to grasp the work that needs to be done, though. For that, confer the Sagehill link for documentation on how to go about that. It would be good training in the event somebody wanted to ever go that route. Personally, if I were to go the DocBook XML route, I would employ a WYSIWYG app like FrameMaker instead of apps using a command line and such. I do not working all that hard.  In any event, it is John who wanted to take on the HTML-creation task. He will soon find out that today, one or more CSS files does the XHTML formatting. (I prefer viewing PDFs over most XHTML, amyway.)  As I mentioned before, I will enable the LO Writer Guide PDF for Adobe Reader markup.

If a wysiwyg editor is needed thee are plenty of OpenSource ones but it's better  to edit the html.

There is  a security issue there. 2.  Keeping the thing updated.  I think wiki-pages are a MUCH better idea.  The links to headers and stuff is  done automatically and it's practically wysiwyg anyway.  Also a LOT f people,  particularly people interested in documentation already know wiki-mark-up but  don't know html.

A PDF not so enabled cannot be so readily \"edited\" by everyday, ordinary readers.  Therefore, I suggest that every OOo/LO PDF file be so converted by Adobe Acrobat Professional afterward, prior to release so that OOo/LO users will have that extra functionality. It only takes a few extra seconds to convert a PDF by Acrobat Professional.  It seems foolish not to so enable them for the Comment and Review function, considering its ease to do so with no added cost or real time and effort...  Gary  "

So primary goal is to attract/ enable/ empower /educate  software users. If some of them really want to highlight the manual or  enter comments, ok, maybe. But this is too far from the original purpose  in my humble eyes. So it might be good to offer it as a service from  someone who believes it makes the difference. But not for \"us\", who are  offering primarily the \"core services\". Just like many Extensions are  built by \"external\" persons.

There is a dormant plugin project on Alfresco Forge for OOo that allows/allowed something somewhat akin to this, although it is still at an early stage of development. I've been in contact with Jeff Potts of the Alfresco project to see if we can't revive development of this plugin, and a phone meeting is planned to take place sometime next week. One of the LibreOffice devs should be attending the meeting, as will the original project admin, as will I, and the idea is to see where the code base is at, and what can be done about getting things rolling again so that we get it functional for LibreOffice.

I realise that Adobe owns the copyright on PDF, but I have a third-party reader on my Linux system, and such readers are/have been available for every/almost every computing platform. So I don't tend to take much account of the \"political\" implications, I just see the convenience/simplicity aspect... So I see PDF as one very practical final publication medium.  ODF's .odt is the format for storing work in progress, although it can perfectly well be used for viewing documentation, provided that the user has LibO or another ODF-compatible tool installed. It allows us to do perfectly adequate version tracking and team collaboration. For instance, if we could get ODF integrated more into Alfresco, we'd have a pretty cool tool. That's something I'll be investigating/agitating for.  Practically-speaking, I reckon we'd be a bit short-handed to produce HTML publications, and I don't see a *screaming* need for it.
