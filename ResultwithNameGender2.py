In the end, I put your version on hold because the work is not yet *entirely* finished: the English needs proofreading for grammar, punctuation and spelling. Also, you mentioned that the instructions need validating with regard to the Mandriva (and certain other) distributions.  The existing instructions are indeed more verbose, but they have been validated in detail by various people (including by a couple of the devs), plus they have been proofread language-wise.  If someone has time to do a thorough proofreading and technical validation on Rogerio's work, I'll be happy to post it on libreoffice.org.  At the moment, I don't have time. But if no-one has picked up the task by the time my schedule is easier then I'll surely re-visit. I still have this thread bookmarked.  Thanks for the work you've put in so far, Rogerio.

In particular, they asked me to work up a website contributors team to complete the building of the website and to subsequently maintain it.  I immediately thought of the LibreOffice documentation team, who know LibreOffice well as a product, and who have excellent copy-writing skills.  Could we form a team of 3 to 5 people (for instance, but maybe more) to work on the following tasks:  1) Over the next week to 10 days, I'd like to put finishing touches to the site content. This includes improving the \"Features\" section, and augmenting the \"Get Involved\" and \"About Us\" sections. It will also include a new section on LibreOffice's attractions for home users, SOHO's, NGO and government users, and corporate adopters. I'll also be listening out for your suggestions for improvements.  I want to get this part of the work done quite quickly, because of the upcoming 3.3 release.  2) I'll be liaising with Christian Lohmaier and Christoph Novack to roll out a News section. This will be an opportunity for the website contributors to do some regular journalism and news reporting about and on behalf of the LibreOffice project. This will be done in liaison with Marketing and the SC. I also have some interesting ideas for interviews, publicity and marketing for LibreOffice, and it could be an interesting and enthralling opportunity for some journalistic writing and for imaginative and creative thinking.  3) There will also be some cyclical maintenance and updating work on the website, in connection with LibreOffice releases: updating the New Features page(s), Installation Requirements, etc.  I think this can be interesting work for us, and a great chance to have fun together and work together. Maintaining the written content on libreoffice.org is also a natural center of interest for us, as \"custodians of the English language\" within the project.  I'd love to hear back from you about this. I'm particularly hoping to form a team of regular, recurring contributors, but why not also consider one-off contributions of high-quality work, if some talented writer feels unable to make an on-going commitment?  We're looking for experienced, knowledgeable people willing to contribute properly-finished, good work. I'll be leading this and, although I will obviously be very attentive to your comments and ideas, I will be pushing forward decisions if discussions look like getting bogged down and slowing progress towards expeditious completion. I'm very keen to see our goals getting completed within reasonable times.  Can the project get your expert help?  David Nelson  "

Here's the procedure of the workflow in Alfresco (sorry for my English -_-!):  Spaces: Drafts, Review, Proofing, Proofing2, Published  Only Alfresco users in the \"Documenters\" group are involved in this workflow. Other users have read-only access to the spaces.  Step 1.     1. A user go to the Drafts space, click \"Add Content\", choose file to    upload, fill-in the document \"Name\", and in the \"Type\" field choose    \"Content\".    2. Someone checks out the file from the Drafts folder to begin editing.       - To check-out a file, click on the \"More Action\" (triangle inside a       circle button) and choose \"Check Out\".       - Then choose the space for the working copy which should be in the       user's home space.    3. The checked-out files stays in the Drafts folder and is marked that it    is checked-out by the \"locked\" icon. Hover at the icon to show which user is    working on it.       - Other users are prevented from editing the file while it is checked       out.  Step 2.     1. The user downloads the working copy, makes changes and then uploads    the file to replace the working copy with new versions.    2. When finish, click the \"Check In\" button of the working copy. The    working copy will be removed and the original file will be editable again.    3. The user is then offered the option to either       - leave the file in the Drafts folder if the file needs further       editing       - or if editing is complete, move the file to the next step in the       process, the Review space, by clicking at the \"More Action\" button and       choose \"Submit to Review\"  Step 3.     1. Another user goes to the Review folder and checks out the file,    downloads it and reviews it.    2. If the file was revised,       - the user check-in the changes       - then choose \"Reject to Drafts\" to move the file to Drafts space.    3.  If it was ok and ready to proceed to proofing       - the user check-in the changes       - then choose \"Submit to Proofing\" to move the file to Proofing space.  Step 4.     1. A user goes to the Proofing space, downloads the file and proofs it.    2. If the file needs more work, it is moved back to the Drafts space by    choosing \"Reject to Drafts\".    3. If the file is OK, it is moved to the Proofing2 by choosing \"Submit to    Proofing2\". This is to mark that the file have been proofed once.    4. Then a second user goes to the Proofing2 space, proofs the file.    5. if the user agree it is ready to be published, s/he choose \"Submit to    Published\" which move the file to Published space. That means the file has    been proofed by two users       "

        "text": "Hi :)  I agree.    However, we sometimes focus tooo much on  extremely rare and unlikely  situations.  This seems to make non-linux users think that we always have to use  one of those complicated methods.  I have had an offlist chat with someone from  here who had a brief try at linux.  He always used the complicated methods  because he never found the gui package managers.  Hmm, i am not sure about expecting documentation to be 100% up-to-date.   Sometimes examples have to be given of specific releases but usually  documentation 'should' make that clear and show which part might need tweaking  if used on subsequent releases.  Also i don't expect documentation to be 100%  good english.  That is partly because we all use English slightly differently.   Different towns, different social groups, different professions all use  different vocabulary and different sentence structures.  We aim somewhere near  perfection and that works well.    Anyway the main point was that your documentation was good and will be useful.   I enjoyed proof-reading it (unlike some people's writings!) but i think someone  a bit more technical might need to tidy up the areas you said were incomplete.   I didn't thoroughly test the process you described but it looked about right at  a skim through.  I was more interested in quickly sorting grammar, spelling and  sundry pedantic stuff like that :)  All was good before but is hopefully a  little better now :)  Thanks and regards from Tom :)      ________________________________ From: Rogerio Luz Coelho  To: documentation@libreoffice.org Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] Install Guide Feedback  I understand (and it is in the Install procedures I wrote)  that the \"easy\" way is to graphically install anything in Linux now, but what if that fails or you want the bleeding edge? This Documentation is for the 0,5% that will ever need it.

        "text": "Hi :)  I have checked just for spellings not even a grammar check.   1. Changed a couple of titles to Title Case rather than normal sentence.   2. Should  be ?  I didn't change it.   3. There was a subsection covering Debian &amp; Ubuntu that had a \"su\" command.  Presumably Debian doesn't have \"sudo\" but Ubuntu does.  So, i split that  sub-section into 2 sub-sections; one for Debian and another for Ubuntu.  If  Debian does use sudo then the 2 sub-sections could be recombined.  Later on a  subsection for Debian &amp; Ubuntu does use \"sudo\" for both distros. 4. Is Suse correct?  I thought their name was now openSUSE http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=suse So, i changed all to openSUSE. 5. 1 instance of libreoffice changed to LibreOffice because it was not in a url  or command-line command or other code, just a tpyo i think. 6. Can the source-code tarballs be used in Hurd distros aswell as Linux ones?   Can they be used in BSD OSes?  Is the plural of Linux = Linuxes, Linii, Linices  or distros?  The term 'Distros' may be changing slightly to include other  unix-based platforms. 7. i changed \"dropdown\" to \"drop-down\" 8. Titles shouldn't have  at the end right? 9.  QuickStarter looked fine as it's camel-case and seems to be a name of  something? 10. I changed a title from \"Un-Installing a Previous Version of LibreOffice\" to just \"Un-Installing  LibreOffice\" to make the section more useful.  Added a line to say that  un-installing previous versions is a smart plan. 11. I think \"deselect\" should be changed to \"de-select\" but i left it as it  was.  It was consistent through the document so i guessed it might widely used  in the rest of documentation in which case it is better to stay consistent for a  little niggle like this.  I thought i had proof-read this document before as many of the errors were tiny  issues that i had corrected somewhere before.  These things take a lot less time  2nd time around so i am not worried about that but it does worry me that i might  have followed a wrong work-flow and stuffed something up for someone else?  For  a wiki i should just click on the \"Edit\" tab at the top, do the changes, add a  summary of the changes made and click on \"Save Page\" at the bottom?

        "text": "Hi :)  Drop-down list is the usual form known out there but it is quite generic.   People outside of LibreOffice do shorten it to \"drop-down\" fairly often but  \"drop-down list\" is probably better for formal documentation, especially since  it is already more widely used.  \"Selection list\", \"selection menu\" &amp; \"combo box\" tend to be slightly more  specific and are trying to make it sound more posh and high-class.  All these  terms are  less likely to be understood and \"combo-box\" is definitely tooo geeky  for most people.  However, they are legitimate as specific types of drop-downs  so please lets not change them just to be consistent because that will probably  detract from the perceived quality of our documentation.  I will try to get back to the documentation i edited yesterday to make  \"drop-down\"s into \"drop-down list\"s.

And with three structures going (the wiki, Alfresco, and ODFauthors), we'll need  to be careful about where the \"real\" work is being done!  "

Therefore the site will soon be running under a libreoffice.org sub-domain (probably alfresco.libreoffice.org) as opposed to the current documentation.traduction.biz name.  Nobody needs to do anything, it will all happen transparently (probably over the next week or so), and documentation.traduction.biz will automatically forward to the new domain.  So please do feel encouraged to carry on working on the Alfresco site, and to start new projects there.  Notably, it would be great if Jeremy and Samphan can carry on with developing the docs workflow there.  A couple of people from l10n have already been showing interest in Alfresco, and there will probably soon be the opportunity to develop special workflows for localization tasks, for any l10n people interested in using Alfresco. Hopefully, Sophie Gauthier will get involved in this, too.  Me, my free time is still taken up with the libreoffice.org website for the next few days. After that, I'll be pulling back a lot from the website, and will be focussing on the LibreOffice documentation project and developing the Alfresco site.  David Nelson  "

For the moment at least, I'd recommend the current wiki page as the place to put final user-ready downloads, ready for links from the libreoffice.org website and direct downloads from the wiki.  At a future time, when the site has rolled over to the new domain, and has gone through a running-in period to troubleshoot any problems, we could *maybe* have Alfresco as even the final drop point, as the ultimate stage in the workflow. But we'd better evaluate that choice at a later date.  In any case, my suggestion would be that the Alfresco site should always house the reference copy of docs, and that we should start uploading all our working content there, for integration into the workflow.

The SC took a decision at its last meeting to accept the Alfresco site a part of its Web infrastructure, and to put it under a LibreOffice sub-domain (probably alfresco.libreoffice.org).  Most/all active members of the LibreOffice documentation team now have an account there, and a workflow has been developed for the English documentation team.  A few members of the l10n community have already expressed interest in using Alfresco. Probably more will also do so once they become aware of its existence.  Certainly, Alfresco has many technical advantages to offer. See my comments below:  IMHO, the odfauthors.org software is far from being an ideal tool for the LibreOffice docs team.  A) The odfauthors.org software is a product of a past time, when leading-edge systems like Alfresco had not yet reached maturity, that does not have all the features and power of a full-blooded content development system like Alfresco: a mature version control system; powerful and sophisticated workflow management; powerful content search capability able to search within the managed content; built-in discussion system that lets you anchor a discussion on a particular content object; easy updating and uploading of content from directly within the LibreOffice applications, via the Alfresco plugin for OOo/LibO; etc.  B) The odfauthors.org software is a hybrid, one-off, custom application without any community taking its development forward. The odfauthors.org system is a software dead-end, based upon a CMS that is not very widely used, for which little technical support is available except from a small group of developers. Alfresco has an entire community behind it.  C) The odfauthors.org software does not have the capabilities of Alfresco to cater to the LibreOffice project's future needs for a sophisticated product that can integrate closely with the project's other development systems. Alfresco can provide a powerful platform for the production and maintenance of developer documentation: API manuals, etc. The odfauthors.org software cannot compete with it feature-wise: it is a fairly manual system that is now dated.  However, no-one going to be in any way obliged to use Alfresco, just as no-one is going to be obliged to develop LibreOffice documentation on the odfauthors.org site.  I think that you can say that, ultimately, LibreOffice project contributors are going to make their own choice and vote with their feet.  My own personal take on things is this:  I think that odfauthors.org is a great resource for smaller Open Source projects that don't have the people, time or resources to properly develop their own documentation.  In addition, I feel that the LibreOffice project naturally has a common interest with odfauthors.org: the promotion of the ODF format. And, as another Open Source project, notably one that promotes the ODF format, we should be supportive of odfauthors.org.  But I think it's in the best interests of a major software project like LibreOffice to have an in-house documentation team with in-house expertise.  No matter what similarities there might be between OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice right at present (odfauthors.org develops documentation for OpenOffice.org), the two products are quickly going to diverge. LibreOffice might as well start developing its own documentation team and expertise now - especially considering the need, at a future time, to develop comprehensive developer documentation for LibreOffice, in view of rendering it truly open.  Alfresco has many essential features and capabilities for that.   HTH.  David Nelson  "

Several of our members are part of this initiative since a long time and they work on several languages.  - The Alfresco initiative is just born, pushed by David Nelson and has, for the moment and due to his very young age, produced nothing. It aims to work on dedicated LibreOffice documentation on different forms. It his hosted by David Nelson and supported by TDF.  - I'm pushing another initiative dedicated to t9n using xliff file format on Pootle to allow TM and glossaries. This initiative needs to be evaluated and pushed or abandoned following the feedback of the translators.  Even if the ODFAuthors initiative has proven his ability to federate and convey users to our project, this should not prevent other initiatives to take place. Each initiative is welcome if it constitutes an emulation and not a competition et if it contributes at the openness and complementarity of the participations.  Members get the same merit whether they participate to one or another and are respected at the same level. These initiatives are here to provide choices and our contributors will be free to choose the one that better answer their wishes. Other initiatives will take place in the future and they will be welcomed and evaluated in the same way.  I hope this is clear for every body and I will add an introduction of the different initiatives on the welcome documentation page of the wiki.  Kind regard Sophie "

We've been rebranding the OOo user guides as an initial set for LibreOffice, but the Base Guide has never been written. Three draft chapters (badly in need of editing) exist, but that's all. One could build on that, and the Base Gyude outline, or start from scratch. Of course, other Base-related materials would be useful, too. IMO the \"Getting Started with Base\" chapter is quite good, so we wouldn't want to duplicate that.  I personally don't have much database experience beyond the trivial, but I'm good at testing, critiquing, and editing, revising... if only we can find some database people to write an initial draft!

It claims to be a  German \"polished\" translation of issue 28136 [2].  As my impression of the doc team here around is rather good ;) I just  want to suggest you to think also of a tutorial-like Guide. Lerning by  doing is Not Bad(TM).   Of course, the tutorial only covers a very little section of the Base  functionality but it enables the reader to work with Base better than  any other doc I found.   So the first idea could be to extend this tutorial (e.g. how n:m  relations are handled in queries, forms and reports).   Another idea might be to add some background chapters about database  theory, but there are plenty of them around so this does not really  seem necessary.

This can be confusing for the unaware, as the only indication that anything is happening is that an icon starts jumping up and down in the dock, which is not the first place one would necessarily look.  As this behaviour is caused by an error in the AppleScript used for installation of the LangPack, I have also filed a bug and included a corrected script which does bring the installation window to the foreground.

So, from now on, I'll be working to get up to speed with Alfresco and the current situation in docs, and will be actively taking part in the work you guys are doing.

Regards from Tom :)      ________________________________ From: Hal Parker  To: documentation@libreoffice.org Subject: [libreoffice-documentation] Writer Guide status / my role  I plan to keep working my way through the Writer Guide chapters in the Drafts space. When Barbara and I finish with them, I plan to start reviewing the ones she has put in the Review space. With any luck, those can go directly to Proofing.  I am not paying much attention to terminological consistency, as I think that's a \"nice to have\" that can wait until the next release of the book and I'm not great at that level of detail anyway. I am trying to do all the rebranding things, but no doubt I'll miss something that someone will pick up on the next pass.  The one thing I am definitely NOT doing is changing the borders and the row colours in tables of data. Now that the OOo books have their tables in black, white, and gray, I can't see the need for taking the time to change them to a slightly different pattern of black, white, and gray. Maybe for a later release, but not now. If someone else wants to do it now, that's their business.  When things are well enough advanced, I'm happy to put all the chapters together into a book... unless the various steps take so long that I've gone off on some trip and am not available. Of course, if someone else wants to do it, that's fine with me.  I've not caught up with who else is working on the Writer Guide, or what they are doing or planning to do.  Hal  "

And perhaps there are ways to automate (or semi-automate) more of the changes, using macros or table autoformats or something, which I haven't spent time figuring out.  We could discuss whether to spend the time on those items when working on the first version of the other books, but OTOH debating stuff takes time that could be spent getting real work done.

I think the Getting Started guide chapters are well enough along to  be considered almost final for a first release. They just need to be reviewed by  someone before being considered final for 3.3. If we remove the Writer Guide  files, what are the users going to read if they need some documentation?  Especially since 3.3 was just released and many people will be visiting the  site. They need to be able to download something, even if it's not finished. The  wiki is a working space as well, in every area of the project.  I also thought that the documentation development page for working files should  not have been deleted so quickly. Alfresco is only in it's infantcy as far as  implementation goes. It would have been nice to have kept it until things are  more ironed out.  Just my opinion though. Ron  "

At a later date, we'll be re-visiting the page layouts with the involvement of our Design team. At that time, we can spruce the page presentations up a lot.  However, if you have new ideas about style and layouts, please do tell us about them, so that we can take a look at them all together, because fresh input is always welcome.

        "text": "I just finished editing the Alfresco Boot Camp file, and I made a bunch of changes and improvements, like fixing spelling and grammar errors, updating it for the new multi-language structure (and capitalized space titles), and reworking some sentences. As far as I could tell, the \"various\" folder was removed, so I removed the relevant paragraph (\"Various is a space which holds files of note that are not under the structure of our workflow. It contains files of different type and use, and is worth poking around to see what is available to you. However, we are currently more concerned with the catalog space. That is where all LibreOffice documentation resides.\")  A few things still need to be done before it can advance. It needs updated screenshots to reflect the new hierarchy. There's probably general stuff I've missed than can still be improved. One significant thing that could be worked on is consistency when referring to the reader. The guide often switches between first-person and second-person, and I think it would be better to stick to one. For example, on page 13, it says, \"we have successfully added our first content,\" but in much of the beginning the reader is referred to as \"you.\" It switches back and forth between \"you\" and \"we\" (sometimes in the same paragraph), which is inconsistent and less smooth. Some of this seems intentional, but I think it's an area that can definitely be improved upon. The index is still empty, but I wonder if an index is even necessary  with text search, its seems sort of redundant. I also didn't implement the changes in the discussions. If someone wants to work on these, perhaps this document can then be moved to review.  A lot of this it trivial, so perhaps it's not worth dedicating a lot of time to; on the other hand, it's the way all documenters will be introduced, and it's a great place for a new documenter to start working (this is the first significant contribution I've made). If anyone's interested in contributing but hasn't done any work yet, this document may be a good place to start.  -Surat Lozowick  "

There is, by default, a \"Guest home\", where all the content being processed on the site is available for viewing and downloading, which is the way it should be. Jeremy's also been working on a view to provide information about work currently being done on the site, which can be integrated into the guest space.  Somewhere during the development work, the site has been configured to redirect unlogged users to the login page, rather than sending them to the guest home. This is something that will have to be adjusted back to the default setting.  As I mentioned before, it would be good to have an RSS feed from the Alfresco site, so that people can stay informed about work in progress without even having to visit the guest home.  Personally, I don't see interfacing with the ODFAuthors project as a *high* priority. It's an independent project, and Jean Weber is already doing liaison. To me, that seems like a perfectly good solution right now.  Plus, what Karl-Heinz is proposing could be quite complex and demanding to implement, and would take a lot of time away from more-important priorities: focussing on workflow and actually producing urgently-needed documentation.  I guess this answers the original topic in the thread, so \"HTH\". ;-)  David Nelson  "

Actually, it should have a character style assigned.    * Similarly, in the Writer guide under \"Finding and replacing text\", names of UI elements are variously unmarked, italic, or bolded.  Which should it be, under what conditions? I consistently made sure they were bolded, or occasionally names of fields or tabs in italic.  But, should buttons be bold and fields be italic?  That is, the rules need to be nailed down.  And, rather than just ad-hoc bolding, there should be a char style defined for that.  * I also note that the '' character used in menu paths, set in \"Liberation Mono\" and bold, does not look good at all.  The arrow head is too small, and it has thinner strokes than the text it is separating.  * We should share a project-specific dictionary with words like 'autocorrection' and 'autotext'.  Having a dictionary, rather than just ignoring the wavies, will help ensure consistant terminology and spelling.  * I see the phrase \"time-varying data\" where the hyphen is shaded as if a field.  But It's not telling me what this shading means.  No tool-tip or interesting information when I right click.  How do I find that?  * Note that choosing \"default formatting\" for a selection via the context menu does not save a Formatting change note!  Somehow a whole bunch of copies of the word \"options\" were in a funny font.  "

OK the big difference is that Nabble maintains a separate archive and has it's own members database - so if you want to post via the Nabble archive you must have an account in the TDF specific nabble database. You must also be subscribed to the mailing list.  Here is the way it works in practice - the Nabble archive right now 'sees' 80+ Mailing lists for TDF, once a person registers with the TDF/Nabble archive then from within the Nabble interface they can go to a TDF/List and have Nabble handle the list registration - you can, from within the Nabble interface opt to receive mails to your personal in-box, but the default it to not do so.   If you registered to a TDF mail list in a 'normal' way, meaning outside of the Nabble interface, then you sill must register with the Nabble database (tdf specific db) before it will post a message to the any list for you - which is a good thing, so no anonymous posting.  Let's look at that again - I registered with a TDF mail list, from my mail client, I go to Nabble and say post this to that list - it says I don't know you, so you register with Nabble and then go to the list and try to post - Nabble will say: You must be registered with the list and you just say - go to hell and post it..it works, because once nabble knows who you are it will do what you ask.  Now you are not registered to a ML from you mail client. You go to Nabble, try to post, are prompted to register, you do so, now you want to post to a list and Nabble again tells you that you must _still_ register with the list (because Nabble does not own the lists) and you say OK - nabble will generate an email to register your email address (the one your registered with Nabble) to the mailing list with the noreply flag, you will get a confirmation in your mail client in-box and you must reply to that just as if you had registered yourself.  Now - one advantage here is that you never need to unregister. This is really good for those cases where someone wants to ask 1 or 2 questions and then doesn't want to see the list anymore. or, a likely scenario, they ask 1 or 2 questions every year or so, this is a common scenario and again this never needing to unregister (therefore not needing to re-register) is handy.  That 1 or 2 question person by the way (and yes I already ran the numbers for LIbO, just like I did at OO.o) makes up the overwhelming majority of list users (and not just on the users list).  To wrap it up - for the OP here, just register with Nabble, for on-going purposes, I wrote this long email as a first draft for a wiki page...will put a link here when it is done.  Thanks  Drew   "

I left change tracking on, so you can see what I proposed.  * It already mentions that names of books and such should use the Emphasized style.  Although I recall from grade school treating the names of books and the names of stories differently, I suppose for simplicity we can have just one.  But, how would we hyperlink/cross reference the name of a different chapter, or worse yet, the name of a section within a different chapter?  * The OTT file already notes that there are styles for Menu Paths and certain UI elements.  I saw that they were not always used, and in fact did not notice such a style at first.  The template admonishes against ever using Bold and Italic or other changes directly.    It states that names of dialog boxes are in plain text.  I changed that to refer to a new LibOUiItem style, which I defined to look exactly like the existing OooMenuPath style.  Also, use the same treatment on all elements uniformly; buttons are not different from field labels, etc.  As for the appearance of the menu path separators, I made a User Field for that.  Apparently, as far as I can tell, I can insert text but not associated complex formatting.  Is there a fancier mechanism available?  So, you need to use the field to insert whatever character and spacing is used, and also apply a character format to just that part.  And, the whole of the substitution needs to work with a single style.  At least, once that is done, you can change the arrow character, it spacing, and its style globally and it changes everywhere.  Related question:  does the template changer add-in pull in \"User Fields\"?  Do they normally replicate in the manner of a style change when you open the document again?  * What fonts are used?  What fonts can/should we use?  I noticed another stray bit of formatting in the OTT file:  one word was in Bitstream Vera Serif.  And in the chapter I looked at initially, the contents of a table is DejaVu Serif and the table headers in DejaVu Sans.  Looking closely now, that is not the definition of the styles, so it was applied directly.  Is there a tool to show what fonts are being used in the document?  It would help identify stray formatting. Likewise, is there a way to identify or search for any ad-hoc formatting, as opposed to text that only gets its attributes from named styles?  "

It is totally integrated with the sister site, and would theoretically be the final publishing platform for user-ready content - the last stop in the workflow, so to speak.

My 2 cents about things would be this:  1) One of the first things I'd like personally to see done would be to rename the OOo styles as LibO styles. I can't think of any reason for *not* doing this. Can anyone else think of any issues that would arise?  2) As regards the menu item separator, I'd opt for simplicity and just use \">\". Using a field feels like an unnecessary complication to me, and I'm not so fond of the arrow in LiberationMono. I'd add a sentence to make this a convention.  3) There no clear conventions in the template about how to express keystrokes and keystroke sequences. My suggestion would be that we should add explanations about this. Again, I'd keep things simple and use \"<>\" to enclose all keystrokes, and I would't bother with special characters from WingDings, etc (for the Mac  key, for instance). So we'd have:  , , , , , ,  +   etc.  However, it's true that the LibreOffice software itself doesn't do this. So what are people's thoughts on that?  David Nelson  "

If the existing file name prefixes fit the bill, we would have \"0202WG3\".  The version would be taken from the Alfresco version, and is not recorded in the file on every edit.  We can put the target language in meta-data too if we want it to show up in tool tips or whatever.  Language is a suggested value for User Properties; use the same two-letter code as we are in the Alfresco directories.  So, a translation might include an introductory passage that states, \"Based on document 0202WG3-en-2.2, with some unique material ported directly from the zh-ch-2.7 that has not found its way back to en yet.  Mostly synchronized with en-2.9.\"  As you see, several documents might be referred to with ad-hoc classifications as to what the relationship is, so I would not include such details in meta-data.

        "text": "Putting the revision number in the document has problems.  Notice that git, for example, doesn't have classic file revision numbers like SVN.  Simple numbers need to be dished out by an authority, rather than just incremented each time the file is saved.  After all, different people can each save the file.  The versioning, whatever it is, needs to be tied with the versioning =system=.  In the case of files stored on Alfresco, that's Alfresco's version number.  When you refer to some revision, it's not just \"some copy I got from so-and-so via some passing around\", but some place you can go and get a \"committed\" version from.  Furthermore, you have some weak ordering so you know if an available version is newer than the one you were using before.  For files that are not gotten from Alfresco, wherever you got them from needs some versioning system.  So, I stick by my analysis, but amend it to decorate the version number with the authority that produced that number.  As a community, we can have a (very small) registration of codes and their repositories, along with a description of each.   So, you might refer to document 0202WG3-[AF]2.2-en, where [AF] refers to this group's existing Alfresco system, and the component could be omitted when it is not necessary.  0202WG3-2.2 omits two components, for example.  We also need to ensure that document numbers are assigned uniquely.  A systematic approach with wildcards can be used to register a whole book of many files, and this list is kept to ensure that new ids are assigned uniquely when someone wants one, but they are still short and reasonably mnemonic. Perhaps we want to flip it around from the current file names so the wild part is always a suffix:  WG3* is \"Writer's Guide for major version 3\" with the per-book note on how chapter numbers are filled to two digits and suffixed to that.  So we need, perhaps on a Wiki page, two lists:  The unique id base part assignment, and the versioning authority information.  "

That way, the system is properly portable to any working environment.  2) The reference version of English documentation should be stored on the English docs team's working environment - Alfresco, or whatever other system the team chooses to use.  3) The document's meta data seems to me to be the logical place to store the versioning info. You get genuine portability and are not tied to any particular working environment. Plus, you're not tied to carefully preserving OS file names in order to preserve the versioning information.  4) The principles and rules of the versioning system should be explained on the wiki, but the English docs team should non be tied to maintaining records of versions on the wiki. All that could be done in an automated manner via Alfresco, and made publically consultable on a login-free web page.  5) We should try and devise a system that is as easy to understand and apply as possible - especially by people without a degree in mathematics. :-D  That would be my own 2 cents.

However, IMHO, we really do need to have a versioning system that is *totally independent* of the platform used to work on it.

I think that  a simple disclaimer as Barbara has been doing is the best work-around.  I guess  it might be good to use an icon set that is not the default for OOo.  However, i  think OOo icons are copy-left'ed rather than copyrighted so it is not the same  as the issue about screen-shots in Windows.  So, while getting the icons sets 'right' is a level of perfection that would be  nice i think that it is unattainable and not really necessary.     One work-around is to get creative and deliberately use a different icon set for  each screen-shot on a page.  The disclaimer should have a clickable link to the  page about how to change the icon set and/or a page with examples of several  different icon sets and/or the design teams page about icon sets.  This would  neatly cover any discrepancies and turn them into a bonus rather than a problem.  Normal policy of aiming at consistency should be followed unless we agree to  deliberately 'get creative'.

Just as a reminder to all :  The reason is simple : Microsoft basically says no \"UI elements, icons or other bits of our copyright protected OS\" in documentation under an open source licence, that is then likely to be sold / commercialised, unless they, i.e. Microsoft, give you permission to do so.  1) MS were apparently contacted in the past (by Florian from what I have read, but I have no actual confirmation of that) about giving their permission to such use in the German OOo community documentation effort, and no positive reply was forthcoming. Remember that at the time, Sun had also signed a mutual agreement with Microsoft to settle all IP-related litigation, but the agreement was not a blanket free-for-all get off the hook. Indeed, most of the details of the agreement never came out, and I'd place no bets on MS having allowed the community \"free electron\" aspect of OOo any leeway whatsoever, contrary to whatever Sun might have gained for StarOffice, its proprietary product offering.  2) The current authoring / documentation community may wish to throw caution to the wind, but it is my understanding that TDF would not particularly relish the thought of being accused of any sort of infringement by MS, or even giving them the chance to do so. MS have had a fairly broad communication strategy of indicating when they felt others, particularly the free software community, infringed on their IP rights in one way or another. Getting market penetration is one thing - doing so at the risk of being accused of infringement is not the way to gain the support of a more widespread public, especially those in executive IT functions, who will have their own legal departments breathing down their necks.  All it takes is one press release from an antagonistic player. It doesn't matter whether MS, or anyone else for that matter, is right or wrong, what matters is the effect it will have on the project as a whole.  Oh, and just because OOoAuthors / ODFAuthors was unaware of this, or chose to ignore it in the past is no excuse. They (as in the \"organisation\") should be equally aware of the problem, but the risks they take are their own.   Alex   "

In one place it was more noticeable in the user was directed to \"select\" something in the dialog.  In that case, the terminology is clearly wrong.  Selecting is not the same as operating on the widget.  Selecting directs the attention to it, and another operation may then be performed, such as toggling a check box.  I suppose in some context where the option itself is referred to in an imperative sense, saying the option is selected is OK and in fact I didn't notice initially.  But you'd have to be careful about the wording of the sentence: are you being imperative or directing the user's action?  It's more consistent and easier to just use a word that always works.  To that end, I'm changing whatever descriptive phrase was used to \"enabled\" (antonym: \"disabled\").  That works for any type of control (check box, radio box, combo-box).  I'm also trying to be more careful about wording things to reflect the desired state, rather than the action.  I.e. clicking on an option doesn't necessarily enable it:  it will toggle it, and you shouldn't click on it unless it was off before.  So don't (just) direct the user to click on something to achieve an effect.  Rather, the effect occurs when the option is enabled.  And of course this is the very case in which merely selecting it doesn't do anything other than make the gui draw a selection rectangle around that item. "

So, for a lot of office users the words might be uncomfortable.   Select and de-select are safe even if i do still shudder a bit when de-select is  used.

The race for funds is open until March 21st 2011, which marks the beginning of Spring in the northern hemisphere. All users - especially enterprises - are invited to donate to the capital stock of the future foundation.  \"After thorough investigation, the Steering Committee came to the conclusion that a foundation based in Germany would provide the best stability, not only for our users, but also for adopters, developers and enterprises. For achieving this stability, a capital stock of at least 50,000 Euros is considered best practice in Germany,\" says Florian Effenberger, Steering Committee member of The Document Foundation. \"Now that we have our first release of LibreOffice, which has been downloaded and installed all around the world, the time has come to legally establish the future home for our community\".  All donations will be used for setting-up The Document Foundation, and after the fifty thousand Euros has been collected for the capital stock, donations over the top of that sum will be fed directly into the future foundation's budget to cover operating costs. Should the race for funds not succeed, The Document Foundation will use the donations to incorporate itself in a different country that requires less capital stock, such as the United Kingdom.  To achieve their ambitious goal of a Foundation in Germany in just five weeks, the community has set-up a dedicated website with detailed information at http://challenge.documentfoundation.org The site will also give adopters, community members and corporate sponsors a voice, and will have special features rolled out at the accomplishment of each donation milestone.  \"We have seen wide support from many organizations, and the amount of volunteer work that has been put into The Document Foundation is just amazing. Without people donating their free time, knowledge and creativity to what will be the future home of LibreOffice, we wouldn't be where we are today. However, volunteer work alone can't fund the necessary capital stock, which is why we have started a public race for donations, especially targeting contributions from enterprises and public administrations adopting LibreOffice, and those interested in an independent, vital and growing ecosystem around free office productivity software\", Florian Effenberger adds.

So, should we then standardize our use of \"Euro\" to this for all documentation, website and marketing materials?  There was also a discussion, with no decision about the treatment of the word \"Euro\". Would we write: 50 000 euro or 50 000 Euro or should we rather write Euro 50 000 or euro 50 000  or EU50 000 ?  2. The setting of the the thousand separator and the decimal point. There seems to be multiple acceptable usages. For example all of the following seem to be correct:  50 000.05 50,000.05 50.000,05 50 000.05 50.000,05  Is there an already \"agreed to\" use of the thousand separator and decimal point for the LibreOffice documentation team?

I think if we were to settle on a standard \"LibreOffice international style\" then we could develop material that would not have to be re-edited. Would we then use the \"50,000.05 euro\" in France or would it be \"50 000,05\" euro?  Would it not make sense to standardise to a style that would be applied to all three groups: documentation, website and marketing?

This has always been the way, and I don't know of any translator who does it any other way.  If the documentation is in English, then let the English presentation preside, ie, a comma for the thousands separator, and a dot/fullstop for the decimals - as for space as a thousands separator, personally, I'm not a fan, but that's just MHO.  As for Euro, the shortened form I see the most often is the standardised banking form, i.e. EUR, much like GBP, USD, AUD, CDN, etc.  If I have to translate something from English to French I will correct the presentation accordingly for that target and vice-versa.

We'd be continuing to work on it, and you'd have an out-of-date copy. It would be particularly sad since we are about to re-do *all* the screenshots in the docs. They're currently mostly taken under Windows. The plan is to re-take all the screenshots under Ubuntu 10.10. And that's just one of the tasks scheduled.  We'd love to keep you with us, Johnny. It seems like a sad duplication of effort for you to be documenting LibreOffice \"over there\" while we're doing the same thing \"over here\". :-D  When you wrote to me asking me where to start, I mentioned that the best thing would be to write to Hal and Barbara on the list, because they are the people with the closest view of the work right now.  Me, I've been busy dealing with Alfresco, plus I've also had client work to do that has meant that I've not actually been doing any documenting recently.  To make up for that, I had volunteered to re-take all those screenshots. But, for instance, this could be one task you could help out with, Johnny.  Hal, Barbara, can you guys organize Johnny and me and point us both at some work, given that you know best where we are with things right now?  By the way, we already have a couple of meta tasks we need to get done:  1) We need to finalize a LibreOffice versioning system to maintain in the meta info of each file we work on.  2) We need to finalize the chapter template.

In case anybody might want to use OOo/LibreOffice in such a  manner, check out that forum topic: http://technicaleditor.livernoisyard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=31 http://technicaleditor.livernoisyard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=31>.  In a nutshell, the project updates published OOo ODFAuthors 3.3 ODT files, ports the \"final\" edited source files into Adobe FrameMaker via the ODT subdocument files that were first converted into DOC files. FrameMaker then reconfigures the book's layout to the desired page format and takes advantage of better typesetting algorithms that DTP apps use, but that fancy word processors like Word or OOo/LibO do not. Also, FrameMaker can do external cross references (xrefs) very reliably, has a dependable master-document (a book, in FrameMakerese...) capability, plus having real run-in subheads--three areas that OOo/LibO, plus Word, do not do well, if at all.  FrameMaker can port (distill in FrameMaker talk) a PostScript (PS) file with the Adobe PDF printer file to use with Acrobe Acrobat Professional for generating the actual PDF, along with bookmarks and numerous specialized output options. Acrobat can then enable the resulting PDF file for anybody using the ubiquitous Adobe Reader application to do markup and comments directly on the PDF--to send back to the prepress editors.  In case anybody might want to do something like this in their organization, e.g., using OOo/LibO for the easier, less-specialized authoring and copyediting tasks and employ real DTP for the higher functions, ask away if you have any questions--either via the email messages or via my forum, or both. I have done these for some time now and never seem to have any real problems migrating the ODT/DOC files into FrameMaker.

In just eight days, some 2,000 donors from all over the world contributed 50,000 for the capital stock necessary to set-up the legal entity in Germany.  \"We still can't believe it,\" says Florian Effenberger, Steering Committee member. \"It happened in such a short period of time and was beyond our wildest expectations. You all really rock! On behalf of the Community, the Steering Committee would like to thank all the donors for their generous support.\"  The 50,000 collected will form the Foundation's paid-up capital, ensuring a permanent future for the organization after the legal paperwork is complete, based in Germany. The capital will be frozen assets for the Foundation: the funds cannot be spent, and we will be able to avail just the annual interest. All money donated from now on will actually bankroll our ongoing running costs for things such as marketing, hardware, infrastructure, attending trade shows, initial financing of merchandising material and, of course, developing new and exciting ideas.  \"So we still need your support: Every donation helps to pay for our future operational running,\" Effenberger adds.

An independent Foundation is a better reflection of the values of our contributors, users and supporters, and will enable a more effective, efficient and transparent community.

Carrying on the tradition of previous OOoCon conferences, the LibreOffice Conference will be the event for those interested in the development of free office productivity software, open standards, and the OpenDocument format generally.  \"We're proud of what we have achieved so far with LibreOffice and The Document Foundation. We are seeing a rapidly-growing ecosystem built on free software, and the LibreOffice Conference will be an exciting opportunity to meet our Community members, developers and hackers,\" says Charles Schulz, Steering Committee member of The Document Foundation and one of the organizers of this year's conference. \"Paris has long been a strong supporter of free software and, following a fantastic release party in 2008, plans for another event in Paris were already being made during the last OOoCon. So, we're happy to announce our first conference taking place in the heart of France.\"  The LibreOffice Conference will host several tracks on various aspects of LibreOffice, including adoption, migration, development and interoperability. More information about the venue and a call for papers will be available soon.  The location for the LibreOffice Conference in 2012 will be decided by the Community in an open Call for Locations process, details about which will be announced soon.  The website for the LibreOffice Conference is at http://conference.libreoffice.org  Information on LibreOffice can be found at http://www.libreoffice.org  The home of The Document Foundation is at http://www.documentfoundation.org  About The Document Foundation  The Document Foundation has the mission of facilitating the evolution of the LibreOffice Community into a new, open, independent, and meritocratic organization over the next few months. An independent foundation is a better reflection of the values of our contributors, users and supporters, and will enable a more effective, efficient and transparent community. TDF will protect past investments by building on the achievements of the first decade, will encourage wide participation within the community, and will co-ordinate activity across the community.

First, the bad news. After having done some particularly-inspired configuration work on Alfresco, it came crashing to a halt and died. This was the admin's human error, not Alfresco's.  All attempts to fix the problem over the past few days have been fruitless to date. If anyone is curious and wants to download a backup of the crashed site, you can get it at [1] - a juicy 759 Mb. It contains everything from the system: database, file system, the currently-inaccessible data, etc.  There is a completely new and working Alfresco installation on http://alfresco.libreoffice.org and http://documentation.libreoffice.org, but all user accounts are going to be have to be recreated.. I will do this as from Friday.  After that, I'll start rebuilding everything. But I currently have no assurance of being to recover *any* data.  Oh, did I mention good news? Again, I should point out that this was 100% human error and no malfunction of Alfresco's. Alfresco has proven so far to be extremely stable and reliable on the server, and the performances are now quite reasonable. This disaster happened in the same way that a perfectly-working car will drive into a wall if you point it in that direction.  Now that the domain names have rolled over to the libreoffice.org domain, I'm planning to contact the Alfresco project and try and get them involved as a partner in configuring and customizing the site.  For the next 24-48 hours, I'm busy and won't be heard much, but I'll be working on things over the weekend.  You can imagine how humbly I offer you all my apologies.

So if you're unable to recover them from backup, we can probably replace them without too much drama after the folder hierarchy is rebuilt and our user accounts are recreated.

Hindsight is wonderful but presumably the back-ups  fell foul of the same problem as the original as does sometimes happen.  See the  new Enterprise where Commander Tucker is unhappy to only have only 1 backup for  a 5 part system that can run on just 1 cylinder (in a pinch).  I imagine David  has been \"sweating buckets\" trying to recover or rebuild and most people have  probably been pitying him while trying to find their own back-ups to help him.

A quick read of the four common guides for producing user guides demonstrated that they might not be up-to-date nor have ever been substantive- or copy-edited. So, I edited one of them over the past weekend. I consider it a rapidly done one-pass work-in-process, and none of the edit changes were accepted, so its edit tracking is available in its entirety.  Some exposition of what I am doing and how it relates to the ODFAuthors guides can be viewed on the forum site that I am employing to construct an OOo to Adobe FrameMaker/Acrobat Professional tutorial (http://technicaleditor.livernoisyard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=51&amp;p=36#p36 http://technicaleditor.livernoisyard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=51&amp;p=36#p36>).

The edited document is expressed in ODT, DOC, and a couple of PDF files. The PDF files were enabled by Acrobat Professional for performing Commenting and Analysis with Adobe Reader, in case anybody would like to practice using that Adobe reviewing feature. A simple Reader application is all that is needed. I encourage my author clients to use that feature, in addition to others, for all our book-layout projects, as it saves us both time and effort for making a small number of edits and such.  In case anybody wants to comment or add to the ODT edit tracking for this document, knock yourself out--either via the authors list, the forum site, or both. However, if you were to submit an entire file instead of itemizing the edits, do so via an attachment on the forum site instead of through this authors list.  I also addressed LibreOffice for this message because of the strong likelihood that they might still be relying on OOoAuthors source material for the bulk of their own documentation.   Gary "

BTW, the OOoAuthors accounts are posted here: http://www.friendsofopendocument.com/newsite/?page_id=194  I usually update the accounts every six months, but I haven't done the July-Dec 2010 set yet. Money from \"GS with LO\" sales doesn't appear until January 2011.  --Jean * To support the work of community volunteers in promoting, improving and providing user assistance for the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) and open source software designed to operate on data in this format.

We already have a multi lingual wiki for our documentation, it will be even better when we will have migrated it to language subdomains.

Not only did we release three LibreOffice versions within three months, have created the LibreOffice-Box DVD image, and brought LibreOffice Portable on its way. We also have announced the LibreOffice Conference for October 2011 and have taken part in lots of events worldwide, with FOSDEM and CeBIT being the most prominent ones.  People follow us at Twitter, Identi.ca, XING, LinkedIn and a Facebook group and fan page, they discuss on our mailing lists with more than 6.000 subscriptions, collaborate in our wiki, get insight on our daily work in our blog, and post and blog themselves. From the very first day, openness, transparency and meritocracy have been shaping the framework we want to work in. Our discussions and decisions take place on a public mailing list, and regularly, we hold phone conferences for the Steering Committee and for the marketing teams, where everyone is invited to join. Our ideas and visions have made their way into our Next Decade Manifesto.  We have joined the Open Invention Network as well as the OpenDoc Society, and just last week have become an SPI-associated project, and we see a wide range of support from all over the world. Not only do Novell and Red Hat support our efforts with developers, but just recently, Canonical, creators of Ubuntu, joined as well. All major Linux distributions deliver LibreOffice with their operating systems, and more follow every day.  One of the most stunning contributions, that still leaves us speechless, is the support that we receive from the community. When we asked for 50,000  capital stock for a German-based foundation, the community showed their support, appreciation and their power, and not only donated it in just eight days, but up to now has supported us with close to 100,000 ! Another one is that driven by our open, vendor neutral approach, combined with our easy hacks, we have included code contributions from over 150 entirely new developers to the project, alongside localisations from over 50 localizers. The community has developed itself better than we could ever dream of, and first meetings like the projects weekend or the QA meeting of the Germanophone group are already being organized.  What we have seen now is just the beginning of something very big. The Document Foundation has a vision, and the creation of the foundation in Germany is about to happen soon. LibreOffice has been downloaded over 350,000 times within the first week, and we just counted more than 1,3 million downloads just from our download system  not counting packages directly delivered by Linux distributors, other download sites or DVDs included in magazines and newspapers  supported by 65 mirrors from all over the world, and millions already use and contribute to it worldwide. With our participation in the Google Summer of Code, we will engage more students and young developers to be part of our community. Our improved release schedule will ensure that new features and improvements will make their way to end-users soon, and for testers, we even provide daily builds.  We are so excited by what has been achieved over the last six months, and we are immensely grateful to all those who have supported the project in whatever ways they can. It is an honour to be working with you, to be part of one united community! The future as we are shaping it has just begun, and it will be bright and excellent.  "

My impression is that there is a choice of ways of working in Documentation and  that updated documents are copied into the various places.  As a result we have  experts in the ways the OOo people work and our experts interface well with  people that have developed significantly better ways with the new systems.   Hopefully this means we can help people move to the new methods at their own  pace.     I'm not sure that we need leadership but we do need confidence.  Self  confidence.  Often people only get that from strong leadership.  Guidance from  people like Hal on how her work-flow works would help .

NOT the Getting Started guide, which was done so early that it may not have the latest rebranding features. http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation OR http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/  If you'd like to do further reviews on the Calc Guide, and if you happen to use Windows, some chapters need some items checked specifically on Windows because they may be different from Linux or they are Windows only.

I declined, choosing to stay in my role of Co-Lead at OpenOffice.org. Now, with Oracle's recent announcement about turning OOo over to the community, I am reconsidering my choices.  A question to you, the members of the LibreOffice Docs team (and other interested people): in the hypothetical situation that I stick up my hand for the Docs team leader role, would you consider me suitable?  Some of you know my style from OOo. I'm a pragmatist: while I'd love to have us maintain a workflow that includes good reviews (both technical and editorial), I think it's more important to get information out there as quickly as possible in a form that's suitable for the general audience. In other words, if enough people are not available to do reviews quickly, then I tend to publish early and clean up any errors later. Similarly, I prefer to have no info on a topic than hold up publication until the info can be obtained and verified; missing info can be added as it becomes available.  I'm also 100% in favour of maintaining the source docs for the user guides in ODT format, which enables us to publish them in numerous formats relatively quickly and easily. This is what we're doing now. (An additional benefit is that using ODT files enables people to work on the user guides without needing to have Internet access while doing the work.) And lastly, writing documentation for an office suite using any method other than the office suite itself strikes me as a very bad advertisement for one's product.  Hoping to hear from you on my question in the second paragraph.  --Jean   "
