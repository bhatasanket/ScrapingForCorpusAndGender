As you probably know, the user guides from the OOo Documentation Project are produced by the OOoAuthors group, which is a community group with its own website. We have been talking about making some changes in the ODT files to make it easier for people to reuse those files for LibO (things like using a variable for the name of the program) but we have not done that yet.  Meanwhile, I have already produced a draft template for LibO user guides and a set of draft files for the Getting Started with LibO guide. A few pictures need to be replaced, and the chapters all need to be reviewed, but most of the work has been done "

I am working with two teammates on the project towards the goal of creating a 15-20 page document by November 17.

Of course, to proceed with this project, we would need your consent and what you think are the requirements for this project.

I put together a draft template for the user guides, but it isn't \"official\" (yet), there is no requirement to use it for the sort of short document you have described, and it might not be the best choice for your doc anyway.  http://www.oooauthors.org/english/libreoffice3/resources/LO3_chapter_template.ott/view   Your document should have a license (copyright) compatible with the project; CC-BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) is probably best. It should be made available in ODT format as well as any other formats you may wish to provide (PDF?).  FYI, here is my wish list for topics to cover for techwriters: http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Dashboard/Tutorials/Targeted#Topics_to_cover_for_technical_writers   Obviously that is too long a list for your project, but the subset you have suggested sounds like a good starting point.

Also, it may very well be that everything is already in place (things have moved quite quickly recently), in which case please accept my apologies.  I have been a volunteer in OOoAuthors for some time now, but I am quite interested in giving a hand in developing the documentation for LibO. At present thanks to the OOoAuthors website and thanks to the great job that Jean is doing, we have a set of well oiled mechanisms and procedures as well as many resources on the openoffice.org web site coupled with a well established working method to help us.  Particularly with regards to the last two points, I am wondering then if we will be able to rely on the same \"service level\" when migrating to LibO.  Here's a (non exhaustive?) list of things that I think would be very useful  1. Release schedule (of course approximate) and version numbering scheme - this would allow some planning (e.g. only update the documentation for major releases) 2. List of new features and enhancements contained in the release - The OpenOffice.org release notes are quite useful as they list all the new features integrated with links to the corresponding issue (if any) and specifications (if any). 3. List of bugs that have been squashed in the release - again OpenOffice.org provides an excellent tool. The current bugzilla hosted by bugs.freedesktop.org is OK but it seems to have a reduced number of functionality (e.g. search, voting, target) 4. Changes to the online help - often the online help is a good starting point when preparing the guides.  Cheers,  Michele   "

I have placed copies of some draft chapters of a Getting Started guide and a Writer Guide for LibreOffice (in .ODT format) on the wiki, http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation  These chapters are ported from the same chapters for OOo3.3, so they may contain incorrect information or screen captures for LibreOffice.  Volunteers are needed to check and update these chapters before publication. Contributors are encouraged to work on these chapters through the OOoAuthors website, http://www.oooauthors.org/english/libreoffice3/ where you will need a login and \"author\" access. If individuals or a group wish to work in other ways, go ahead.  I intend to continue making chapters available for LibO as we update them for OOo, but otherwise I do not have time to be involved in organising or coordinating the work on LibO documentation.

My point was that installation instructions should be included with the package and/or in the download page.  Or much better, instead of telling the user what he should type in the terminal, put it into a script and call it something like \"setup\".  I usually expect any software I download to automatically install itself with a click. Which is what usually happens when you use any \"popular\" operating system (and distro in the case of gnu/linux).  I'm still a newbie with Ubuntu and I've only used it for a while, but i've installed a few programs and this was the first time I downloaded a program and had to _figure out_ how to install it.  By the way the procedure mentioned in the blog article of converting the RPMs into DEBs with alien doesn't work, it prints a lot of error messages and doesn't generate the expected debs.  If the most \"correct\" way to install libreOffice in Ubuntu is from the debs, then I don't understand why they are not linked to in the main download page, it's a bit absurd that one has to google for them.  You may argue Ubuntu is just one of many distros, but the same can be said of.... whatever distro uses RPM packages.     "

Maybe not needed for the problem you identified (these mistakes are generally corrected during the revision process) but to create new \"features\" requests or enhancements as LibO moves from version 3.3 to future releases and new functionality is made available.  Unfortunately I have no experience in this area (besides filing bugs) but it would help to have a documentation category in the bug tracker. This never happened with OOo because the OOoAuthors produced user guides are not an organic part of the project and setting up a bugzilla for the documentation only is a bit of an overkill.  I think this is one of the most attractive aspects of LibO compared to OOo (in the documentation area): the chance for the documentation besides the online help to be a rightful and integrated part of the project.

Feel free to use or change it. Note, that it may be  inaccurate or outdated.   Verbal description (AFAIR):  There are 2 main workflow pathways: A simple one for internal documents  and another one leading to externally published documents.  The internal path only has 2 states: draft &amp; published internally.  The external path includes 3 different document states:  internal draft,  pending review (which means, submitted for publication),  published externally.   Transitions are, of course, submission, publication, and retraction (the  latter leading back to draft state[?])  L10N: Documents from any state might give rise to translation  activities, which again would open the same (or a similar) workflow for  the (now localized) document.   The main 2 problems in the (folder based) Plone system IMHO was to find  a document (where is the newest version?) and to get a quick overview  over the project state (how many documents are in which state, how many  untranslated documents, etc.). Hence, keeping track over the project  had to be done mainly by a human (i.e. Jean ;-) ).  Also missing are \"minor\" state informations e.g. \"checked for software  version X.Y\" or \"indexed\" or \"branding updated\" or similar (which is a  minor point but nice2have, and could be done e.g. by tagging).

As for the website, this has been in some teams used only as download  container for ODT and PDF documents.

Much manual tweaking is then required to end up with an attractive, well laid out odt to convert to pdf.  Starting with odt and then outputting to other formats generally works well, IF the odt is created using an appropriate template and layout rules. However, some of the layout in the current OOo books does not work when output to HTML and some is a bit messy when output to wiki format. Post-processing may clean it up, but more manual intervention may be necessary. I have not found time to rework the layout and template to avoid (or at least minimise) these problems.

Depending on who made the edit, he will either just leave the edit as is (if it's from a known contributor) or validate the edit (if it's from an unknown contributor).  - With each release of OOo, he reviews the edits on the Basic and Admin guide. The Dev guide will only get a cursory review due to its size.  - There currently is no publish cycle for the Dev Guide... mainly due to its size (+/- 2000 A4 pages)  - With each _major_ release, Clayton packages up the Admin Guide and Basic Guide in ODT and PDF formats - he generally doesn't do this for point releases. The Admin Guide and Basic guide have, historically, been translated by Sun (into about 6 other languages), so part of the release process included preparation work so that the Sun translators could extract the Wiki content and translate it.   - The community contributions for the Dev Guide are different from the contributions for the User Guides. The Dev Guide is more or less a collection of concepts, not a book you want to read from cover to cover. In the Dev guide, the contributions come almost 100% from Sun/Oracle developers. External contributions are rare.  So, there's not much of a release process in place. The nature of the development documentation is that it's a continuous evolution, and not so fixed to each specific release of OOo.  --Jean    "

An updated font and colour scheme will be very important to make it appear 'new'.   This sounds fantastic. I have found in my work as a professional end user I always use outline numbering. It makes it look more professional and brings with it some big advantages for ease of use. I don't think it would make it unapproachable as Jean suggests as a lot of end user products now use numbered outlines (See Wikipedia:OpenOffice.org). I also think this more professional look would also assist the LibreOffice product in breaking into enterprise markets.  Jean:  This is a challenge. The good part is that if the chapter and numbering system does not allow us to do this we can alter the program so that it can handle this requirement, and it is a very important requirement for many professional end users.

Pages that do not define a responsible user inherits the responsible user of it parent. This can be implemented in Drupal as a field on the chapter edition page, hidden when viewing it, and the we can do reports on who are responsible of. Ok, now we know who is responsible of what chapter... now what? What we need to do with this information? Get a notification if the book is modified... what else?  This page has more info than you want, but one relevant part is the list  You're right, always exporting or changing from one complex format as ODT to Wiki/HTML has problems. We will check the performance of the ODT Import module for Drupal to know what are the capabilities of the plugin. If a correct import is done, people could work on ODT and then import them to nodes on Drupal, so people will be able to read it online on site as a book in many ways.  Cheers  "

So, I have homework :P  For Internal linking I usually use http://drupal.org/project/pathfilter  with http://drupal.org/project/linkit for a good user friendly internal links feature.

I don't think that a formal decision has been made. Up to now, there is  no official (or inofficial) team in charge of the doc project. So who  should make a decision? Things are just evolving ;-)  But anyways - I think it would be a good decision to take ODT as master  format for User Guides and Wiki as master for Developer documents.  Conversion ODT -> Wiki and vice versa is possible but time consuming,  so keeping both formats in sync does not seem a good option unless we  have enough people taking the task.  With using drupal as CMS there could be a third option: to produce  drupal master documents which then could be offered in web form and  then transformed to ODT/PDF, but this possibility has to be implemented  and tested still.

I'm a member of the Drupal team.  However, I am also a member of the marketing team. If I could perhaps just add my opinion to this.  From the perspective of the \"outside world\" the public face of the LibO documents section, it would seem to make sense that documents be provided in the first place in our native ODT formats. This should be trumpeted as our success in document achievement. I think that this is an expectation that we all share.  Also, if we are going to keep advertising the virtues of the ODF files. It would seem to make sense that we find ways to make the ODF files system \"play nice\" with the internal document flow. What better occasion would we get than having the use of a corporate-like structure such as the \"TDF/LibreOffice document team division\" use the ODF files internally at developing documents from start to end. We have our devs on-side for the development of an Office Suite championing the use of ODF, would it not make sense that we would try to make the creation/editing of internal ODF documents part of the internal process? The devs could could help in making this work. We could then, without any doubt, suggest and prove that using the ODF in creating documents in a corporate structure, from start to end production, is entirely and assuredly possible.  If so, as a group of committed document editing professionals, as you all are, you could use this occasion to streamline the ODF documents to work in such a process.  This would certainly help in marketing our LibO Suite as a viable office suite for the corporate/enterprise world.  Just my thoughts.

As a general rule of thumb, you can expect to run into installation problems with 800-1000 or more installed fonts. In practice, you'll probably encounter system slowdowns with fewer fonts. There is no magic number. The maximum number of fonts will vary from system to system due to the way the Windows System Registry works.  There is a Registry Key within Windows (for Win9x and WinME versions) that contains the names of all the TrueType fonts installed and the paths to those fonts. This Registry Key has a size limit. When that limit is reached, you can no longer install more fonts. If all your fonts have very short names you can install more fonts than if they all had very long names.  But \"too many\" is more than just a limitation of the operating system. Do you really want to scroll through a list of 700 or even 500 fonts from within your software applications? For best performance and ease of use, you'd do well to limit installed fonts to fewer than 500, perhaps as few as 200 if you're using a font manager as described below.  http://desktoppub.about.com/od/fonttechnologies/f/toomanyfontswin.htm  Besides the registry limitation, you have to consider memory limits as well. 600 or more may cause slow performance for a users pc. But I agree that installing a few fonts is a good idea. I have just over 200 fonts on my system and I've had OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice and Microsoft Office installed.  I'd be interested to see which fonts are installed with the current LibreOffice installation. Anyone know? I think installing 10 or so fonts with LibO would be a good number.  Ron   "

On the cover page there is a field at the end of the line \"Getting Started Guide\" which hides that line on the title page of a chapter when it is part of a book. IMO that line is redundant in a full book. Of course you may prefer to have that line on each chapter in a compiled book, in which case by all means delete that field.  Of more importance: there are two blank spaces before the name of the chapter. These are essential for correct spacing of elements in the footer when the chapter is part of a compiled book (using a master document).  BTW, Ron, I'm going to retrofit some of your edits into the OOo version of these chapters, because they are improvements on what's in the originals. Thanks!  And while I'm going through your edits to pinch the best ones, I'll probably accept most of your changes (other than the questions that others need to consider) and put the result on the website as the latest version.  --Jean     "

I'm a Brit myself but, certainly at the moment, it seems more realistic to target getting a comprehensive set of documentation in *one* variety of English. So maybe \"International\" English with US spelling is the best option at this time. Perhaps when the LibO project is at a more mature stage, there will be manpower to do localized documentation for Australia and New Zealand, Canada, the UK, the US...  As regards punctuation, when I write professionally, I like to use punctuation that conforms to formal grammatical parsing, like as wot Winston Churchill sed.  Anyway, for the proofreading that I've started, I'd be really grateful if you could maybe watch this thread, where I'll be posting a few questions:  http://www.libreoffice.org/lists/documentation/msg00172.html  A big thanks if so. :-)  David Nelson  "

However, we might get this issue - people sending out Liberation Sans or Droid Sans-filled documents, with the receivers wondering why the document doesn't look right. Then again, if you're sending out documents where formatting is key, then you would use PDF, which embeds the fonts...?  I think, if you distributed ~20 or so fonts, it would be no big deal for space or for hitting that font limit. It could only be a benefit in the end users mind, especially if you add in the Droid fonts (which imo look the best), as it's a new set of fonts to play around with.

Feel free to give it a good workout and thanks for the help in ironing out the bugs.  *****PLEASE LEAVE IMPRESSIONS/FEEDBACK ON THE WEBSITE MAILIST THREAD HERE  http://www.libreoffice.org/lists/website/msg00932.html  ******  Marc  ===================  Hi everyone,  We think the editor of the Drupal site is ready, please could this kind community give a try and give us feedback :D  The main page is here:  http://libreofficeaustralia.org/richeditortest/rich-editor-test-book  Please leave all the formats so we can continue testing on this page.  So can create as many you want childs for testing here:  http://libreofficeaustralia.org/node/add/re-test?parent=1275  Things to consider:  - Full HTML is not allowed, the tags, attributes and even inline CSS styles were configured, so, if you observe that the filter is taking out a generated style please let us know. - I've selected and grouped buttons on what I think is a good balance between website security and usability of the editor. Please, if you need some other functionality let us know. - The caption and upload image feature (se below) are javascript , so not avalaible on configurations with javascript disabled.  - The CSS of the images blocks and the little magnifying glass was a quick thing, I know it's not perfect.  Features of the editor:  - Well most of you can see. Everything should work. - You can resize the image (changing width and height), and a filter  actually resizes the image and, if resized, the image links to the original. - If you put a title to and image a caption below of the image will appear.  - If you don't want a caption to appear you can remove the title of the image or remove the \"caption\" class of that image. Double click >> Advanced >> Classes  - The link button now has the abilitty to link easilly to internal content.  Known bugs:  - Inserting an image in Firefox shows a broken image. If you preview or  disable/enable the editor the image appears. This is a bug in CKEditor: http://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/5218 (Upstream bug)  http://drupal.org/node/725154 (Drupal bug) - The option \"Cleanup styles on standard paste\" is enabled, but it's not  working for some reason. I'll check that later, until now, you will have to use the \"Remove format\" button when copying for another web to remove  the formmating or use the button \"Paste as text\". - In-editor live image resize doesn't work on Chromium, but works on  Firefox. You can resize an image on Chromium by double clicking on it and changing the values of heigth/width. Ironically, you can not resize  an image in the live resizer on Firefox because of bug 1.  Pending:  - A more user friendly link to files. Right now you can upload files and  create a link, but is not so user friendly. - I haven't defined a criteria for the search of internal linking, so everything  shows up. Try typing \"Libre\" to see it work. - Lightbox on click on a image?  Notes on implementation:  - I've tested a lot of modules for image handling in Drupal:  Image Assist http://drupal.org/project/img_assist Image browser http://drupal.org/project/imagebrowser WYSIWYG Image Upload http://drupal.org/project/wysiwyg_imageupload IMCE http://drupal.org/project/imce  And discarted all of them. At the end, I implemented a custom image upload as explained here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLB9-1t_mrE  That includes the modules: cck, imagefield, transliteration, image_resize_filter, insert, image_caption and lightbox  I've updated this page to reflect the current state:  http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Website/Drupal_Modules#User_interface  Now, some sleep.

The custom styles do not need to set up with their parameters initially--just give the styles appropriate, useful names to serve as arrows in your quiver to use when needed.  If you intend to use subdocuments in a master document, you might want to take care not to use a generic term for a paragraph style, say Title, in all the docs because an automatic generation of a ToC would treat all such styles with that term the same--usually not what you want. To get around that, you might want to include custom styles named Book title, Chapter title, Front-matter title, etc.  Anyway, it is a good habit to start with some custom styles (as needed) right from the start when designing any template.  For practice, every so often I might take an OOo template, make some changes to it, then save it as a DOC file and import that DOC file into Adobe FrameMaker and see how that goes--usually (hopefully) pretty straightforward and flawless. FrameMaker is a much better medium for bookmaking in that crossrefs between external subdocuments are much easier to effect and thus are more reliable. Besides, FrameMaker is a hybrid word processor/DTP app that has better typesetting algorithms than a fancy word processor. (Adobe InDesign is even better yet). But that is my personal preference as to building books (master docs) for PDFs or print.  Also, MS Word makes beautiful tables with ease. So converting them afterward to another medium like OOo or FrameMaker can take advantage of that Word feature. You could create a series of custom tables in Word and collect them and convert them for later use in OOo or FrameMaker--provided that you do not mind using packages developed by private companies. Some people have hangups about using a proprietary software package or O/S.    "

I slightly altered the English for what, IMHO, would be better for an international reader base, but no major rewrites. I reformulated some sentences, added bits, etc. Anyway, you'll see all that.  IMHO, it's a nice draft.  If it was for the LibreOffice documentation set, I'd suggest \"Power Users Guide\" for the title. That's the audience it fits, and it doesn't have much content that makes it really specific to technical writers.  A few ideas: maybe you could address the subject of bibliography a bit more, for example? (Even if not in too much detail.) Same thing for fields? Also, maybe you could cover MACROS (macro recording, if not macro programming), and the advanced aspects of find-and-replace? (Regular expressions is what I'm thinking of.)  Anyway, IMVHO, it's nicely written and packs a lot into a small manual, so that more-advanced users can get up to speed quickly without having to read large volumes of documentation.  I understand you have a size constraint to comply with. If you don't have time or if you can't write much more (because of your project rules), maybe I could help you develop the above suggestions.

I think people have found it a good way to exchange opinions and information quickly, and have also found it a great way to get to know each other better and develop a team spirit. Of course, there are almost certainly people who prefer just to do their contributing without having that kind of interaction with other project members.  But I'd like to suggest organizing a conference call for documentation contributors - at least as a one-time thing (we could discuss the idea of regular or periodic conferences during the call). Some reasons for doing this are as follows:  1) I'd like to talk to some of the more-long-standing contributors and get a better idea of what material and resources the project already has, and what we could usefully work on developing.  2) We could get an idea of how many active documentation contributors there actually are in the LibO community.  3) We could talk about workflows, and try and establish who would like to play what role(s).  4) We can discuss working rules and conventions, to help new contributors like me get up to speed more quickly.  5) We can talk about the above more quickly than via posts to the mailing list, and can then follow up with further development of what we discuss, on the mailing list and on the wiki. If anyone's interested, we can also work live on a Google Wave (I could provide a place to do that temporarily until the project gets its own Wave resource, and we can make the Wave public).  Any reactions about all that?  If people seem favorable, I can follow up with Florian Effenberger to arrange for access to the Talkyoo channel, we can set up a poll to see when the best date and time is (hopefully in the *very near* future), and I can create a wiki page where we can work-up an agenda.

One of the biggest problems causing the need for users especially new ones to need help is the lack of a good users manual. The OOo documentation site is very confusing, there are too many manuals to choose from and nothing says anything like \"If you are a new user, this is the one you want\". I could be wrong in this, but I don't think that I am. The only module I ever use with any regularity is Writer. If I can figure out how to use it, I might use Calc for a personal check register, likewise I might use Base for a list of all my DVD collection, but it's Writer that I use daily. I suspect that I am fairly typical in this, and that perhaps 50% or more of OOo, and now LO users use Writer far more than they use the other applications. A survey might tell us if that is so.   Assuming that it is, I think the primary users manual should focus on Writer, with just one chapter on each of the other modules, and a pointer to where to download a more extensive manual on each. Where I disagree with most who write in, is that I think that a basic manual like I describe *should be in the download package*. In order to keep it small for that reason, it should be in ODF format not PDF, and it should be formatted for an 8.5x11 page rather than the usual 5x7 so that it would be practical for the user to print out without the horrendous paper waste of the 5x7 format. (Remember all printer paper comes in 8.5x11 or similar) Also keeping it to 100 pages or less will both keep the download size down, and encourage users to actually print a hard copy. (a hard copy is very useful because you can read in the manual while using the software) I find help often less than helpful simply because it can be difficult to both read how to do a thing and simultaneously do it. I recognize that a much longer and more detailed manual is required to completely cover subjects like Styles, but for all beginners, and most other users a manual like I just described is what's needed. Probably organized with an introduction to the most used commands, then a tutorial, then a reference section.  This could be one thing that would set LO apart from other packages that offer good word processors, Even expensive MS basically sucks in the area of manuals and user support. Years ago they used to be much better in this area. Good user support seems to be the first thing that for profit companies give up when they think they can get away with it.  ========================  I was just wondering how large was the Writer documentation and in what format is it available? Of course the Writer module would be made downloadable for LibreOffice users if this were possible rather than his suggestion of including it in the package.  How logical does his suggestion sound?

At one point we were not allowed to put the ODTs on the main OOo website because of license differences, but there are links to where one can get them.   2) In most cases, the PDFs are *smaller* in filesize than the ODTs.  3) The PDFs of the OOo Writer Guide and the other user guides in their current form (for V3.2) are NOT formatted for 5X7, although at least one older version of those books was made available in the PDF used for the pre-printed guide sold through Lulu, which is close to that size. The current are formatted for reading on screen and for printing 2-up on A4/US paper.   After complaints from users who wanted to print them, the draft V3.3 guides (and the first draft of the LibO guides) have been reformatted for printing on A4/US paper size.  4) OOo provides the user guides in chapters as well as full books, because we know that often people want only a subset of the information.   5) Surely the answer to \"if you are a new user, this is the one you want\" is the book titled _Getting Started with OOo_.  Having said all that, I agree that improvements could (and should) be made. I think the current \"Getting Started with OOo\" book, at over 350 pages, is much too long. My original intention was to have it no more than 200 pages, but it grew... people kept adding things and it's hard to decide "

And after I change the style on one page, and I scroll to another page that has a different style and click in it, the highlighted style in the Styles window doesn't change to reflect the correct style for that page. Does anyone else experience this?  Ron  "

(I am assuming the files on the LibO site are the latest; is that correct?)  For example, there are a lot of Getting Started files on the Review List at OOoAuthors, so a potential contributor (who is familiar with OOoAuthors) would expect that those are the latest iterations awaiting further review or editing. But when looking in the Feedback section for LibO Getting Started on the OOoAuthors site, I find quite a few files with more recent dates than those on the Review List. This suggests to me that when files are updated, the previous version is not being removed from the Review List and the newer version added to it. And it's not clear to me whether the files in Feedback are the latest either.  I found similar issues with the Writer Guide files. Thus there is much room for confusion and potential wasted effort.  If the LibO team is going to use the OOoAuthors website for tracking docs, then I strongly suggest that it be used properly.  If the LibO team is not going to use the OOoAuthors website for this purpose, then two things should be done: (a) the existing files should be deleted from the OOoAuthors site, so they don't mislead people. (b) some other tracking method should be implemented (through the LibO wiki), so potential contributors to LibO docs know what stage various chapters have reached and whether those chapters are being worked on.  I have been talking to someone who is interested in helping out but dismayed by the situation described above. And I was considering updating some of the files with changes I made recently to the OOo docs (correcting errors, clarifying info, adding missing info), but I did not know which files I should use.  --Jean   "

We just need to wait for them to meet with a full quorum and then there can be an *official* decision... I'll follow up this coming Monday unless you have other ideas?  Jean, I'm currently thinking out a possible workflow system for using the wiki, but I'd say we should continue the collaboration with oooauthors... I'll have proposals to put to you all this weekend, probably involving me offering to handle the \"checking-in\" of documents once a work assignment has been done on one of them.

Besides, mediawiki has extension that can  export to odt/pdf any time and make it available for offline reading or printing.  See the example here: http://www.den4b.com/wiki/ReNamer At the time of starting the wiki, I already had written most of the manual in odt format. So I saved the individual chapters in mediawiki format, and pasted them in the wiki pages. I had to upload all figures separately and link them. But on the whole the experience was smooth.

For OOo/LibO user guides (docs aimed at end users, not developers), ODT as a source doc works better (at least in the short term) for these reasons:  1) LibO docs team is using the OOo docs as a starting point, and the OOo docs are in ODT. (The user docs on the OOo wiki are not up to date.)  2) Going from ODT to wiki gives a good layout, but going from wiki to ODT (or PDF) does not; the layout sucks. User guides have too many illustrations, tables, and other features; Mmch fixing up is necessary after export from wiki to ODT if you want a professional looking result.  3) Going from ODT to PDF is easy, and layout is preserved. As stated in (2), going from wiki to PDF gives poor layout that needs much work.  4) Using a wiki does NOT eliminate the proofreading effort. In my experience, using a wiki as the source document results in MORE need for proofreading. Althugh reviewing/editing may be done on the wiki, tracking the changes is not as easy as in ODT; asking questions and getting answers is not as easy; edited wiki pages often/usually need further editing for grammar, comprehension, etc; and much more checking of page layout etc is needed after export to ODT.  5) At OOo most of the people interested in working on user guides say they prefer to work in the ODT files.

I work for a rather large county government and all of our documentation is developed and maintained on our intranet website. All of our documentation is web-based, and only once a year do we export the data and create publishable user guides for training and archival purposes. We've always found it easier to use a web-based documentation platform to collaborate, create, edit, and publish documentation because the documentation will always be up to date. Plus, our users only access this documentation via the intranet website so there is no need for them to search through multiple physical documents. Plus, I think users would rather find all the documentation on a searchable website than to download ODT/PDF files.  I understand the desire to create these ODT files since it's an intuitive method to showcase the capabilities of LibreOffice, but I believe our time could be better spent creating an up to date support site where any of us can edit the documentation. Then, maybe once a year, the data can be copied/exported to ODT as a printable, hard copy of the documentation.  I know most people here will disagree with me, but this is just my $0.02.  Jeff    "

Whether users would rather find info on a website or in downloadable file depends entirely on the users, and that depends a lot on the product and the level of knowledge and experience of the users of that product. My work at OOo suggests that a large number of ordinary users prefer PDFs that they can print out. Others, of course, prefer web-based.  I am also highly dubious that more actual work would be done on the user guides if they were on the wiki instead of in ODT. That has not happened at OOo; there, the writers, editors, and reviewers overwhelmingly prefer to work in ODT, and many of them (including me) are actively unwilling to edit on the wiki.

If from the existing OOo docs, then are you saying they should be wikified before people make the LibO-specific changes? Wikifying existing docs is a lot of work, so it seems to me that the first step should be updating the content of the existing ODTs and then wikifying them. After that, maintenance could occur on the wiki, as you suggest. Personally, I don't think that is a good idea for reasons I stated in previous notes, but the group could choose to go that way.  IMO for the first release of LibO, ideally we would have PDFs and printed books available, as well as info on the wiki. Started from the ODTs is the fastest way to do all of that.

(see their massive catalog here: http://pediapress.com/books/)   Each book is nothing but an exported pdf from wiki. (In fact, all those exported pdfs are available for download free of cost at PediaPress site).   So professional formatting in exported pdfs may not be an issue.   BTW the default setting of the extension is to export pdfs meant for black-n-white PRINTING.   (all text color is stripped, and links are converted to footnotes so that reader can read them).     However, PediaPress shared with us some 12 tweaks that produce pdf files meant for reading on screen.  (The exported pdf has full color text/images, and we can click on its links to jump to another \"marked destination\"/URL.)   Unfortunately in case of ReNamer, we have a shared server, so those tweaks could not be used.  (The changes will affect all other users too.)  But I do have a list of those config changes, which I can share if people are interested. (Basically some parameters are changed in a few Python files at server).  No harm in trying! :)   @point-4: Wiki has built-in DIFF tools to see any version vs any older version.  You can roll back with a single click.  Even changes in images are tracked.  The mother of all wikis, Wikipedia, has other more sophisticated tools for managing wikis. These are available for free download.  In fact, I have found that wiki's \"Discussion\" page is the idea place to ask question, or even to place an alternative mock up of the page. Then other reviewers can compare these alternatives and post their opinion on these versions. Finally we may use one of the versions or a mix of them.  I have actually DONE this in the example provided. :)  BTW these discussion pages are not suitable for intensive proofreading (where multiple people are commenting simultaneously). Reason: They have to keep a track of what the OTHER critiques are saying. This is really strenuous, because you have to open the relevant page of the odt and visualize each comment. Rather than 10 reviewers pouring through their 10 odt files to track each-others' comments, using a wiki is far simpler.  Regards, Narayan     \\t\\t \\t   \\t\\t   "

Well, that's valid only the current version: If Libo is to be \"extensively re-written for contents, and not features\", we may need new docs. Then using a wiki makes sense for a fresh document.  ****** Another important thing to note: All of us agreed that OOo cannot easily export an odt file to wiki.  Does it not strike you as a valid development target for LiBo? LiBo should excel in this area; because wiki (and web in general) will touch many more lives in future!  What is a software if it cannot resolve the pain points of its own help authors?  Please pass on the word to Charles Schulz! :)   -Narayan  \\t\\t \\t   \\t\\t   "

Just to be clear: I don't think ODT is the best medium for providing docs to users, but I do think it is the best medium to use as the source documents from which a variety of outputs (PDF, wiki, print, other) can be derived, thus providing for the needs and preferences of a range of users.   I don't think so. Anecdotal evidence only. IMO no one medium will make everyone happy, because of the wide range of age, experience, computer sophistication, etc among users of office suite software.  One thing that could, and should, influence decisions on how to deliver docs (not how to produce them) is: what audiences is marketing targeting? If marketing is targeting mainly web-savvy groups such as students, then the primary delivery mechanism for information can, and probably should, be different from what might be best for a more diverse or less-savvy audience.  The audience segments that I am most familiar with are, typically, not comfortable doing web lookups (regardless of the format the info is in once they find it) and often do not have a reliable, easy to use, affordable connection to the web. These audience segments include small businesses, small volunteer organisations such as church groups, and seniors (btw, there is a fair overlap between these groups). People in these groups very much need free (in both senses) software, but their information-gathering methods are very different from, say, students or people in in larger businesses.   --Jean     "

(Let him decide for himself.) 2. For the chosen role, the step-by-step process      (For example, how to pick a doc for editing, how to submit it for comments, how comments are collected, how version conflicts are avoided, how the document is deemed to be \"ready\", how to find the templates, how to propose a new document, how to propose a new chapter in an existing document, etc..) 3. Link to a FAQ which each joinee may ask (e.g. \"how do I...?\", \"why not...?\") 4. Links to the source OOo docs, and where the edited \"WIP\" drafts (for LiBo) are to be stored.

As I said above, ODTs and PDFs exported from the wiki are very poor for complex books like the user guides. For example, in addition to other layout problems I mentioned, I now recall that if you aggregate multiple pages into the PDF output, you lose the hierarchy, especially once you include several chapters.  One can export the Wiki to ODT and clean up the result, but the cleanup is a lot of work. I had thought that less work was needed for the OOo Basic Guide, the OOo Admin Guide, and and the Developer's Guide, but I was wrong. The person who does the work says it varies from manageable (on a small doc like the Admin Guide) to a very long process for the large Developer's Guide.  So I repeat what I said earlier: the PediaPress extension to MedaiWiki  may work well with some fairly simple Wiki page sources, but when you have complex formatting the output starts to look VERY amateurish and  unprofessional. There are ways to work around this, but not quickly and easily. Going the other way, from ODT to wiki, is also a lot of work but the results in multiple outputs are much better.  --Jean   "

        "text": "Hi, :-)  I've been reading this thread, and my feelings are somewhat split.  On reflection, as a general idea, I like the idea of having the docs on a wiki, because of the easy availability and searching of all the content. In the fairly near future, LibO's built-in help is going to be wiki-based. If I'm not mistaken about the plans, it will be available within LibO via an interface that fetches from the Web initially and then stores locally.  MSO and Windows has this functionality, and it makes updates easy to provide.  Production-side, it could work if the basic formatting of content is kept simple and complies with some production guidelines.  If we agreed on that, we could be up and working quickly.  I do think we should try to use the material currently available from OOo as a starting point, and should then start writing on our own. In the not-so-far future, the UIs of LibO and OOo are going to diverge to such a point that there won't be sufficient commonality to make it worthwhile trying to write \"one size fits all\" docs anyway.  But:  1) The formatting you can do on a wiki is quite rudimentary. And manual. The writer is faced with the task of being a typesetter at the same time. And the editor has to tread carefully between all the mark-up.  The style sheets currently available on the TDF wiki are quite rudimentary, and would need some adaptation/enhancement/reconfiguration.  2) I've been summarily investigating the availability of workflow management extensions for MediaWiki and haven't found what I hoped for.  Nevertheless, one *could* use the concept of group access to partially manage roles/permissions, combined with a previously-laid-down set of agreed procedures. Even so, basically it would be quite a \"manual\" process that depends a lot on the discipline and cooperation of the team contributors.  Speaking personally, I'm not too much into the idea of \"throwing the doors open to the world\" to get people writing, because *quality* is likely to take a steep dive, or to create a big post-editing workload.  One thing we've got with the material that Jean and Ron have been porting is *truly professional-quality* documentation in terms of the copy (I'm not thinking about the presentation, which is also up to the same level). And my ambition for the LibO project is to maintain that high quality.  3) Michael is very keen on using Drupal as the team's tool. I \"have a date\" with him this week to evaluate what he already has available, and to hear/see - in concrete terms bereft of hype and jargon - what could be developed. My past experience with CMS products tells me that Drupal certainly *could potentially* provide the docs team with tools. But I'm uncertain about who's going to do the development, and about the current progress and expected readiness deadline of that development.  We need a working system *quickly*, so that we can stop debating on the list and actually start producing documentation.  4) Jean has oooauthors.org up and running. I've not taken time out to see the workflow organization much, but I'm pretty sure she's got something acceptable that's already operational.  I must say that it rather gets in my face that it's branded OOo and not LibO, but never mind. I would also prefer it to be a TDF/LibO resource, too, but it's not. However, it does have the advantage that *it exists and works*.  Aside from oooauthors, we don't have *any* automated workflow for working with ODF/ODT files (even though they are in many ways a better starting point for conversions and excellent presentation).  So, as you can see, the issue of \"wiki, ODT or Drupal\" is very much a swings and roundabouts thing.  But I'm starting to drift towards wiki and a Web-based documentation that we then also export to PDF, and that is easily consultable by our users *now*. It's the quickest operational solution, barring Jean's oooauthors.  I'm trying to figure out a workflow that uses the TDF wiki. I've been working on some Linux installation instructions, and on the TDF community bylaws, which has taken most of the free time I have to give the project. But I'll be having some more time in the next few days.  I'm very impatient to get to a point at which I can actually start *producing documentation*. I'm hoping that we're all going to arrive at a consensus quickly, and that we're not all going to be pulling in different directions like a herd of cats.  So much time is wasting, and we have *so little* documentation ready for our users...  I think we need to choose an acting team lead to direct things. I asked Jean, but she's not willing.  I'm offering to take on the role myself.  Would I have your support and cooperation for that? Or are there other candidates?

The reason is the user would mostly jump from a particular screen, and you have to help him about that screen.  On the other hand, a user's manual would have more theory (compared to built-in help) and also a different flow of topics.  So both these documents have to be separate.  Probably Microsoft has tried to solve this by inserting \"All about\" sections in its help file. So while the help screen focuses on the controls of a particular screen, the overall picture is not lost. The user has TWO choices now: He can check what a control does, or understand the entire topic top-down.  *** BTW all this discussion means LibO should make it a priority development target to be compatible with such web-based documentation.  Regarding the \"online vs offline\" debate, I have seen the following arguments:  Why online: 1. The time of offline editors like MSO and OOo has come and gone (in favor of online editors like Google Docs and MSO live) 2. The netbooks and pads will force people towards online editors.  Why offline: 1. Most/many countries and regions don't have enough bandwidth, or reliable connection,  2. Many users have or their lifestyle forces them to have only intermittent access to net. 2. Even if the net is accessible, many people can't afford the cost.   So catering to both types of users would mean making a documentation system that is convertible. This conversion may not be \"live\": For example, wikipedia does the wiki-to-pdf conversion periodically. On the other hand, there is the PediaPress approach (convert your own odt/pdf ; or Print-on-demand).  Regards, Narayan    \\t\\t \\t   \\t\\t   "

To make some *effective* progress with producing the large amount of documentation that is currently lacking, someone needs to become acting documentation team lead until such time that TDF makes an official appointment.  I have 25 years of professional experience working with technical documentation. I have only been involved in LibreOffice since the TDF launch, but I have been doing some writing, proofreading and reviewing for the project over the past couple of months. I am concerned and care about the current state of inactivity and disarray in documentation work.  I offer to taken on the leadership and coordination of the team until that time. Florian Effenberger has agreed to grant me wiki administrator rights, so I will be able to do things such as reorganize the documentation pages, move pages, protect pages, delete pages, undelete pages and various other actions necessary for establishing a workflow for the docs team.  I plan to organize regular team phone conferences, and to listen carefully to the ideas and opinions that team members voice. But then, after that, when a decision needs to be taken in order to allow tangible progress with the team's work, I plan to announce a decision and to proceed with whatever action is necessary to make it happen.  Obviously, I can't do all the work by myself, and I am hoping that team members will feel that it's worthwhile to cooperate and contribute, and that a significant number of you will also take part in the work with me.  If anyone feels that they are better qualified to take on this role, and is willing to put significant time and work into the project to make things really start happening, then please do speak up, and we can let meritocracy and natural democracy decide the issue. If there are other candidates, we can organize a vote by team members. (Let's define a team member as someone who speaks up in this thread, and who is willing to actually work on documentation, not just lurk silently or unproductively flame and distract the debate.)  I have already approached some SC members. They told me that the organization is not yet there to make any official appointment, but that there is no reason why I can't take on the role on an acting basis, if I can convince team members to work with me. So I have *some* kind of tacit approval to try and make this work. Let's say that my understanding is that they will stand back and watch what develops. And then at a later date they will make their official decisions as they see fit. But this is certainly *not* an officially-approved initiative.

If you feel you're a better candidate, then please speak up and tell us *why* and what your concretely propositions are. In that case, I hope you're willing to back that up by contributing lots of active work and time to the project. Because I promise that *I* am.  If you actively disapprove of my initiative, then respond with -1.  If you lurk and say nothing, I will consider that I have your tacit approval.

Maybe a localisation team representative can join us on the next documentation call to discuss their needs and you can explain how the system will be implemented. Clearly there can't be a different system for every language, however as we discussed, if this were to be transitioned to the Drupal site under development some time in the future I am sure that editorial quality and localisation teams would be very happy with the outcome.  I would love to be able to try out some of the editing systems sooner rather than later as we are quickly approaching launch of 3.3 with an RC out already. Could some people on the documentation team get access to write?  Martin Srebotnjak wrote:  There are no 'big guns' in the LibreOffice project as has been discussed within the Steering Committee and on many other conference calls. However there are too many localisation teams to discuss and decide with every one regarding infrastructure, which would likely result in duplication and un-coordinated systems. AFAIK there is an understanding that if people are interested in 'how' something is implemented such as documentation, websites, marketing, etc. they join the appropriate team who makes an informed decision while requesting input from stakeholders. It is a simple flat structure which with collaboration between groups should work very well, as is happening with the Drupal website that is being developed. I can't see this being any different.  The Drupal team is working hard to ensure that no matter what language you will be able to contribute to these core infrastructure teams when the site is launched early next year.

From previous posts, I think it has been decided to start off with the published OOo 3.3 docs and redo the work we've done on the LibO docs that are there. Partly because the OOo docs are more updated and make a better starting point, but also because there are some issues with the LibO files that I've been working on (explained earlier) that make it necessary to start afresh.  You might want to check with David, but I think the next steps are to take an OOo chapter and start porting it while incorporating any worthwhile changes we've made so far to the LibO docs.

Instead, I recommend that Michael should set up a GraphMind (http://drupal.org/project/graphmind) on his Drupal site, and then we can create the mindmap for this subject.

Which tools facilitate online collaborative authoring     (This includes editing, comments, diff function that compares ANY two versions, acceptance/rejection of changes, rollback) 4. Which tools allow conversion to offline manuals that can be read on screen. 5. Which tools allow conversion to printable books with excellent formatting.  Once these choices and their relative strengths and weaknesses are known, we can then allow voting.  BTW I think not many people are even aware of Michael's Australian website.

Further, all authors would have to agree on common set of tools so that they can collaborate. (Each author can not insist on using his own tool; otherwise there will be compatibility issues later.)  The choice of authoring tool should not be finalized based on the preference of a few early joiners. It should be based on a thorough analysis and comparison of the available tools.  Since that conference call didn't materialize to finalize the authoring tool, then the next option is the website.  In fact, if Drupal itself has a powerful books module which can be export as viewable OR printable pdf.  Thus \"website\" and \"documentation\" are not isolated concepts. In fact, regardless of the authoring tool chosen, the LibO website will execute the workflow partly or fully. So the web team is very much a facilitator/enabler for the documentation team. Therefore the web team and the documentation team would have to work together.   I don't know what you mean, but no one is going to develop any tool, right? The authors will simply make use of an existing offline/online application or service. Say, one of the options is for you to install the Drupal book module.  -Narayan  \\t\\t \\t   \\t\\t   "

Since all are volunteers, any forced standardization is a risk. So the points raised by Sophie are important: there will be people willing to help only if they can do it \"the usual way\".

When OOo authoring started, many of the collaborative authoring tools were not so sophisticated.   OOo authors may be having their legacy issues.

If I were to put myself in the position of a first time user of LibO and was directed to that page, I would literally say \"you gotta be joking !\". What use is an online help system in a wiki that doesn't show index links to the main topics. This is a minimum for any help system. As for the search engine, well, I've never been very impressed with most of the search engines used in default wiki implementations.  The user must be given the possibility to browse through the pages of help via links that appear, as they did in the \"inline\" help system of OOo, otherwise as far as I'm concerned it is absolutely useless. If and when the user comes across a topic for which they know the keyword to search for, then they could of course use the search engine to enhance their browsing experience, but IMHO you can not forego the immediate visual need of a user. An example to look to in this case would be the API documentation of OOo, yes, you can search for the terms using the search engine that Collabnet provided, but you can also drill down via links through the various API descriptions.   Whilst I appreciate that it must have taken a lot of work to get this up onto the wiki, IMHO the visual accessibility of the information really needs to be addressed.   Alex    "

There have been many postings on many of the TDF mailing lists about Drupal, but - in reality - there has been no official decision to adopt a Drupal site at the moment, not for documentation and not for anything else. No official decision could be taken before The Document Foundation [TDF] has a board of directors, at which time the board of directors will take any such decision.  As for the handling of documentation by a Drupal site, that would first depend on a decision being taken to adopt Drupal as a tool for the docs team. That, in itself, is far from being a foregone conclusion. Other solutions exist (use the wiki, etc.).

Even a Drupal-based workflow could involve several quite different options.

If there is a need to access, edit and republish documents under development through a native file system network folder I would we suggest we go towards leveraging these tools and move away from the work that has been done already. On the other hand we could use a version control system just like the development team does with GIT when working on and submitting source code, and Drupal supports this without the need for additional applications which would also support native file system support you are describing.  On both counts however it requires an end user to learn another system, unlike the point and click type of system that OOoAuthors has and I have been working towards on Jean's advice.

We'll see what happens in that respect in due course.  I think what I can more usefully do is to offer myself as an \"acting central contact\".  I can be there to be contacted by and liaise with outside parties wanting to make contact with docs people. Then I can relay communication to the docs team, and channel back any reactions from docs contributors.  I can act as a spokesperson for the docs team, when needed, by listening to the docs contributors and gaging the general consensus/streams of opinion and relaying that to outside parties (the SC, etc.).  I can be there for docs contributors needing guidance or a central figure to communicate with about their contributions. In particular, if you have a wiki-related problem, I have full admin powers and am there to help you out. Same applies for the upcoming LibreOffice website.

However, it sounds like you think that role should be more managerial. Perhaps that is because you come from a work situation where team members are required to follow their manager's lead? My experience has been more with groups of volunteers, where motivating people is high on the list for a leader but there is less expectation that people will carry out the leader's decisions.

        "text": "Hi Sophie,    I have subscribed to the l10n mailing list just on Friday, after I learned that there were some discussions there I was not aware of until then.  Now, the explanation about wikihelp.  As you may recall, the conclusion was described as:  \\tcreate help-packs - split out the help for each language \\tand simply have no help installed[1], but a web link to on-line \\thelp[2], and a \"download your help-pack here\" direction \\t\\t+ not even English help would be installed - \\t\\t  this will save us 11Mb in the 170Mb download  Also, each and every release notes of betas and even RC1 contained a note \"The help content is not included. We are working on the online version. Alternatively, it will be possible to install it separately.\"  It is my mistake that I did not explain the exact way to implement it in advance, I am sorry for that.  So let me explain why wikihelp:  Wiki is so far the best free tool for collaboration editing I know of. It gives anyone the freedom to improve things.  With help implemented as a wiki, any user of the suite can (potentially) just describe the functionality better, should he/she find out that something is described wrongly, or just partially.  Also, why should be your native language just a translation of an English help?  Should you have people that can improve the help, but cannot speak English, why should they be bound to translating only, when they can author the text?  Why should be the French help just a translation of an English help, when it can be an own (better?) version?  This is why I believe implementing the help as a wiki is the best thing to do.  How does it work:  - for 3.3, I am converting the .xhp files into wiki markup   - it is now online as http://help.libreoffice.org   - missing translations yet, I need to polish the tooling first   - when the tooling is right, I'll add 2-3 more languages, for more     testing   - when even that approved, I'll upload the rest  - anything untranslated in the localized versions will be marked   appropriately   - a template for that, like {{NeedsTranslation}} + the English version  - after the import is done, and people are happy with it, it will be   open for account creation   - for now, please ask me directly if you want to have an account     there, to edit pages like Main_Page, or Template:*   - other pages might get rewritten by the import tooling  - after 3.3, I'll start to work on tooling to convert it back to offline   help   - to platform native help system     - Windows/Linux/MacOSX   - from the engineering point of view, we don't want a home-grown help     system, as we have now   - needs more research, to see if we don't lose features etc.  - when done, the wikihelp becomes the authoritative version of the help   - but we'll still be able to incorporate changes from the .xhp files,     when merging from OOo   - we can agree that some of the localized versions would be locked for     editing, and just taken from .xhp and .sdf files, but I _strongly_     advise against that  Open questions:  - extended tips   - cannot be part of the wikihelp, most probably these have to be     handled separately, and translated using the normal process  - anything else?   As you might have noticed, anybody can ask for the git account, and anybody with a bigger contribution is offered with write access.   Oh?  Were you following what we are doing on the development mailing list?  The last months, we have spent days and nights reviewing and fixing patches from new people.   Why do you think that people want to break your work?  Do you really think that making something yourself is more effective than just reviewing someone else's work?  How could it scale, if you were doing everything yourself?   Yes, will do, and sorry again that I haven't summarized all this before. If you can point me to the messages I probably missed due to not being subscribed to the l10n@ ML, that would be most appreciated.  Thank you, Kendy   "

There are many technical solutions possible, including uploading the English wikihelp pages to pootle (so far it is done per paragraph anyway), and having chosen languages read-only in wikihelp, generated from the English version + pootle.   Maybe I am entering a thin ice here, but do not think we have a good help as of now.  There is so few information there, in many times in the form \"'Insert Picture' functionality inserts a picture from a file.\" ;-)  We need to grow the family of the documentation writers, and we cannot do that by using the current tools.  Authoring the .xhp files as we have now has a terribly steep learning curve (see the description of the xml language that is used for that, or the description of how to use the extension for the help authoring http://documentation.openoffice.org/online_help/helpers/helpauthoring/guide/OOo2HelpAuthoring.pdf).  So we need to do the work easier not only for the translators, but for the help authors, or the documentation team in general, too.  And I believe that with wiki, this has the biggest potential to scale.   I am sorry I haven't stressed this enough still: For 3.3, I am just importing the help to the wikihelp, there is no change in your processes.   It is again solvable, it is easy to provide dumps of the wiki (believe it or not, bzipped it has only about 1.4M per language), for the offline grepping.   I think the biggest issue is the offline editing; and I think here we can use the Wiki Publisher (http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/wikipublisher)  to edit the pages in LibreOffice.  I did not test it yet, but if the extension misses the functionality to merge the changes done in the wiki, it will be easy to plug it to LibreOffice document merge feature.   It is just up to the wiki setup - we can of course have a group of admins who will be giving rights just to the selected people, etc.   Understood - please see my other mail to JBF about fighting spam.   I see, OK.   No, it does not have to be open to everybody, even the account creation can be restricted to selected group of people only.   Sorry, I missed yours, if you mean \"HC2 l10n process\" :-(  The best is to CC: me explicitly if you need the answer quickly, normally I just scan the ML subjects quickly, read the interesting ones, and read the rest of the messages later in batches.

We are not going to impose something on you that you don't want; and we can't make the decisions in a vacuum, we're part of the same family - so lets try to collect requirements together in a friendly way :-) If you have some, please knock up a wiki page with them. Some are quite interesting, eg. the French localisation legislation is fascinating and a new concept to me at least.   \\tSo - there is no need to open the wiki for editing ever, if that is a huge problem for people, and certainly we don't have to do this for 3.3, and certainly we don't have to open the wiki so just anyone can turn up from the street and spam it :-) [ it is easy to have approved translators only eg. ]. We can provide solutions for off-line editing, and there is certainly no need to switch tooling to make the wiki the authoritative data source now / yesterday :-) we can do that in a month / never if there is some insuperable problem.  \\tAnyhow, I suspect there are perhaps three problems here, none of them truly technical:  \\tA. People are paranoid about developers dictating new tools \\t   to them that do not meet their needs / quality \\t\\t+ but this isn't going to happen \\t\\t+ and hassling people providing new options is not the \\t\\t  best way to have your requirements considered :-)  \\tB.

We should have a simple, light version accessible via Pootle for localization to be distributed with or along the product, what is currently called HC2. A more documented part available to the localization team via Pootle but optional because not part of the product, the wikihelp.

I guess from all the discussion here we see that the LO developers and documentation team wish to get help onto a new platform, where it will be easier to maintain.  On the other hand the localization teams who have invested big resources into translating the huge help system wish to continue working like before in a Pootle or similar environment.  I propose you develop a system to have English help editable on wiki but fully transportable back to the po/xliff system (interchangeable). All the translations would start from the English po/xliff help files and decide whether to a) strictly translate English help (like we Slovenians decided) and keep working with po/xliff files; the online help would be updated from these files at least with every minor and major release; or b) develop their own help in the wiki and never go back again;  Before I go on I need an answer to a question. I tried the help in RC1 and it seems that help items do not get passed to wiki i.e. the default module help page opens even if you press F1 in a certain dialog (the previous bundled help showed that definite topic in the help). Is this how the wiki help is envisioned? If it is, one need a lot of searching to even get to a certain topic and this makes the help totally unusable. If this is the case the wiki help should only be a web version of the bundled help, just a copy made after every release from the release translations.  Lp, m.  "

And finally, dear documentation team, I'm sure we will soon have good knowledge on how to use those new and unavoidable features our developers have designed with the help of your nice writings :-)  I would like to thank every body for the great work that has been already done and will be done for our first version all together :-)  [1] http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Marketing/LibOReleaseEvents/LOPressKit/FeatureList3.3  Kind regards Sophie "

Otherwise the lang teams will not ok the release thus only the English version will be an official and tested release, and all the rest will be untested. Think what that means for adoption of LO in enterprises and government sector. Not good at all. For all other languages 3.3 seems to be a preview what a LO will look like in 3.4, and not a full featured version, a kind of LO beta.   This is a very good question.  In the current implementation, I do not  The transport of (English) help from wiki back to xliff/po must get all the keywords references, links etc. How is that handled? Will the index in LO offline help work after such a backport from wiki? This is of major importance. Offline help without index and table of contents etc. is not usable.  Kendy, why do you have to rush at this online solution for 3.3? I propose to leave things as with OOo for 3.3, with help packs as separate downloads if they are too big to be included in the international package. In the meantime you can get the conversion procedures working so that no metadata from help gets lost and on the road to 3.4 all the teams and LO projects decide about the future of LO help system. What you are driving at is having a non-fully-working solution for 3.3 with already some decision in place at very short notice (and such decisions mostly lead to headache) and then decide for future. What I propose is a fully working solution for 3.3 with enough time later to decide and make a new system working fully for the 3.4 release.  Lp, m.  "

Also installing LO on multiple systems should provide option to install also the langpacks (I believe that is possible now, but maybe some more automation should be provided, given that it is two packages that need to be installed, not just one, the fully localized build, as with OOo).

The installer would then run in that language and automatically offer GUI and dictionaries of that language as presets, and offer the appropriate help package download.  I prefer language selection based on user selection and not on the OS language, because some users have English GUI in OS, but want a localized LO.  Example: if I am Slovenian, I would select Slovenian language, the installer GUI would be Slovenian, the defaults for installation would be Slovenian GUI and Slovenian and English dictionaries. If I would want to manually change the things to install I would still be able to select and deselect other languages etc. And at the end of installation I would be warned that help is only online and that for offline help I must follow the given link to the Slovenian helppack.

        "text": "Hi Hal, :-)   The prime mover behind oooauthors.org is Jean Weber, who is a really dedicated contributor with valuable editor and publishing experience. I must admit I have great regard for her. She would make a perfect team lead for documentation for LibreOffice, but does not feel like taking on the role.  My personal reasons for not yet being convinced that oooauthors.org is the best place to centralize the LibreOffice docs team work are these:  1) There are products that should be evaluated, such as Alfresco (http://www.alfresco.com/), which might be a more up-to-date approach to collaborating on documentation.  2) Oooauthors.org is, AFAIK, hosted on consumer-grade hosting, yet houses a very large database with lots of essential information, and the fruits of contributors' hard work (as far as documentation is concerned). AFAIK, the database is never backed up. If, for any reason, the site went belly up, we'd be sunk. The site itself seems to need a *little* technical love and attention - people sometimes encounter little glitches.  Really, it would be better if the site were moved to the TDF/OOodevs De server, where it would be administered by experienced geeks who would solve all the problems and keep things safe. But that won't happen unless the domain name changes to a TDF domain, and oooauthors.org does not agree to that. So there seems to be a deadlock there at the present time.  3) I feel that the LibreOffice documentation project would do better to develop its own workflow, without being bound to an outside party such as oooauthors.org (or even odfauthors.org, or whatever). This is partly a matter of pure prejudice, but also because I feel we should have all our expertise \"in-house\". I wish Jean would make the switch and join us 100%...  At the present time, there seems to be no clear consensus about these things among contributors. The only real consensus among docs contributors *who actually do work* for LibreOffice seems to be that ODT/ODF should be the central medium for production, with other formats being provided as well for final output.   This is a problem. At the moment, any kind of organized work on docs is entirely dependent on people being sufficiently disciplined to update the few pages we have keeping track of docs changes. It *can* be done via the wiki, but the wiki is not a really good medium for changes management, workflow automation, etc.  Attention is urgently needed to this problem.   LibreOffice aims to be meritocracy-driven. The guy who actively starts doing the work gets to lead the way. Therefore, if you've time and inclination to take a lead role in this, and you have ideas that get a consensus of agreement after consulting the team, you can make the difference. So feel free to take action. The only point I'm trying to make is that it is better to consult the other contributors first, and get *some kind* of green light.  I have full wiki admin permissions, so if there's anything I can do to assist you or facilitate things, feel free to contact me on- or off-list, and I will do my utmost to cooperate.  I'm concerned about these issues, like you. But for the next week or so, I'm putting a lot of work into the libreoffice.org website which, IMHO, is an even more urgent need. So I've temporarily put on hold my own efforts to address exactly the same issues you're talking about. But I *will* be thinking more about this. ;-)   They're cats, mate! :-D They all run in different directions! The LibreOffice SC is currently seems to be applying a policy of \"hacker anarchy\" and laissez-faire. So it's not easy to organize things. If you think you can manage it, go for it, I'd say.   You're quite right. I see that Ron Faile has given you valuable pointers. Ron is one really good contributor to the docs project: he works and doesn't talk much, and is perfectly willing to cooperate with people. All the documentation we currently have has Ron's hand in there somewhere.  If possible, try to avoid changing the file names of the GS guide. I've linked to them from the upcoming libreoffice.org website. If you upload files, please could you always leave the old versions there for the moment, just in case we ever need to roll back for some unforeseen reason?   You're a man after my own heart, then, and you'll be a welcome and valuable addition to the documentation team.  I look forward to actively doing the same when libreoffice.org is online.  But, if you do have ideas, please do tell us about them. Maybe you can help us bring order to the current chaos.  David Nelson  "

This gets an additional state of `back'. `No'== no second person has seen it. `Back'== a second person has seen it, but has edits and `Yes'== a second person has seen it and it's ready to progress to the next step.  The third column is renamed to `proofing' and follows the same logic as `feedback'. When it's state is `Yes' though, it is signed off in the fourth column, `publish'. This means it's ready to have the EDIT tag removed. We would need to add a 5th column for sign out.

Some native-lang groups will produce its own documentation, some others will translate what is available in en_US language or other languages, and sometime it will be both.  For the FR project, I'm currently testing some tools for the translation of the OOoAuthors Guides.  Translating on the wiki is horrible, I've translated two guides and they are now completely obsolete and not in sync with the rest so it's a waste of time finally.  With the .odt files we can use translating tools, glossaries and translation memory. I'm testing WordForge as the local translation tool currently (it manages odt -> xliff -> odt), and I think also to use Pootle to organize the workflow (you can assign roles and tasks, you know the amount of work is remaining, it's easy to check for errors like missing translation, double punctuation or missing caps, extra space, etc, you can work on line or off line and it handles xliff files).  Would you be interested by this workflow at an i18n level, or do I go on only with the FR group here? This question because it needs more testing (will do after the 3.3 is out), and some styles (the low level ones it seems) will have to be adapted in the .odt file for conversion purpose to .xlf files. So it might be interesting to adapt it to your current workflow and requirements too.  Kind regards Sophie   "

I'm not too sure precisely how we can work i18n into our own workflow... If you have specific suggestions then I'd be interested to hear.  One package I'm currently interested in is Alfresco... I plan to experiment with it between Christmas and New Year... Maybe there is a possibility with this tool that we *could* design a more integrated workflow with interested i18n teams...

In the past, I have created some of my own documentation for the OOo project, and then translated it myself, however, translating other works has always been a right royal PITA. I originally posted the following wishlist on the French discussion list the other day :  - be able to translate an *ODF* file in such a way that homogenous vocabulary terms are used throughout (e.g. using a translation memory, glossary) ;  - be made aware automatically that there has been a change in the original language document from which the translation was made;  - be able to easily collaborate on a translation, be it by division of labour (e.g. segmentation),  or through proof-reading / copy / revision writing, and being automatically made aware thereof, each time a change occurs ;  - not having to be online to be able to do the work : one of the banes of most of the solutions I have seen proposed so far is the requirement to be online to actually work on a document - please do not make this an obligation, not all of us live online or have permanent access; the corollary of this possibility, is also being able to update the work done once an online connection is available again;  - when a new document is put online, being made aware of that fact via an automatic notification (e-mail ?) what I like about the Silverstripe CMS at the moment is that I am made aware each time a change is made to the site for which I have publishing rights - this is a superb piece of functionality as far as I'm concerned ;  - be able to tell others simply and efficiently that I have reserved a document or that others have reserved a document to work on - ideally, this would be proposed automatically.   Maybe these requirements are impossible at the moment with the solutions available to us, but something like that would be far more motivating than anything I've had the unfortunate displeasure to use so far :-p  Alex   "

Also, sometimes these office suites are distributed via CD's with other OSS software or included in an OS, so there is no download page to see this warning.

I have bookmarked your email regarding the requirements for international documentation, and I will add it to the growing list of requirements for the documentation development and revision work flow. These are clearly infrastructure demanding requirements, and we will be investigating ways to meet these requirements, unfortunately I can't give you any straight answers at the moment as we require some time to digest and discuss how these could be implemented within Drupal.  To be clear, there has not been any decision to use Drupal as the primary documentation development tool, but once we have established the work flow and determined a way to coordinate this across languages we will be putting the system up for the assessment of the documentation and localisation/native language teams.  Thank you for the very clear and concise summary of some of the ideals. Personally I would love to see a system which does not favour any language, and developments in any language can be propagated through the documentation of all languages for the benefit of the entire community.

But, she explained, in LibreOffice, there is a drive towards giving each NL project independence in producing its own content, in the form it thinks is best - even though an English version of a content may be offered as a possible working base, if the NL project wants to adopt a \"translation-based\" approach rather than an \"own-creation\" approach.  You can see this in the SilverStripe website, on which each NL project gets a sub-site that it's free to structure and people with content as it sees fit. For example, the French or German NL projects are not in any way obliged to have a site structure that is a \"clone\" of the English structure. They might adopt a quite different IA for communicating with their user base and servicing its needs.  (I must say that I rather like these ideas.)  So we'd be looking for a system that caters to this autonomy.  HTH.  P.S. When we're talking about NL, we're talking about *languages* not \"national/political\" boundaries.  David Nelson  "

The funny thing is, that pictures (\"the\" media content\") won't get updated within this dialog - so it would be somehow incorrect. I assume that it is the same for videos and sounds.  Then, I miss the reason for asking - it is implicitly contained in \"most recent content\", although the external data might not have changed in the meantime. And what happens if the user does not update all the links?  Then I'd like to ask whether you plan for different buttons and/or dialog titles - or is this the default Yes/No behavior? If yes, then the user would get the important information in the second part. It is usually recommended to provide it as early as possible. That's e.g. the reason for the \"self-speaking\" buttons. (I agree that LibO/OOo still misses such specific dialog guidelines like the Gnome HIG or stuff Apple/Microsoft/... provides.)  The last sentence \"Go to Edit ...\" is I'd like to see in the help (referring to a sub-section to the , but not in the dialog itself.

We are a very young community, and as such just starting to develop this infrastructure. If you wish to translate the existing English documentation into Hindi I am sure we will be able to integrate with the infrastructure when it has been commissioned. Our current workflow has only been established for the English documentation, however I am personally working on a proposal to truly internationalise the documentation development.  If you wish to put in the effort to translate the documentation into Hindi prior to the LibreOffice 3.3 launch I would suggest downloading the ODT of the file you want to translate, then using Google Translate to create a first pass, very rough translation of the PDF file available on the wiki. You could then copy the translated text back into the English ODT file in order to maintain official formatting, tables, images and figures, from which you could modify the text to suit the Hindi user base. Although there has been no official decision, I would expect that the documentation team requires that formatting, layout, colours must remain the same across languages (Localised fonts excepted, but if substituted, an open font would be much preferred).  An example of using Google Translate to create a first pass is: http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=en&amp;tl=hi&amp;u=http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/cgi_img_auth.php/c/c2/0101GS3-IntroducingLibO.pdf Simply go to http://translate.google.com Paste the web address of the PDF file into the box and press translate.  I would strongly advise against 'creating your own' documentation, as has been suggested, as this would most likely not integrate well with the official documentation workflow once established.

        "text": "Hi Michael, Sophie, Kinshuk, all, :-)  @Michael: you're quite right that the English documentation team hasn't chosen its tools and workflow yet, and I know you're currently working on ideas for us all to examine together. I'm looking forward to that. ;-)  @Kinshuk: It's true that TDF and the LibreOffice project were only recently launched *as a separate entity* from OpenOffice.org. But the actual community *behind* LibreOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) and the software have existed for 10 years, and many of the people now contributing to the LibreOffice community are veterans with many years of experience.  With regard to NL teams: NL (native language) teams and communities are not in any way obliged to adopt the same workflow or tools as the English documentation team. They are totally free to decide on their own approach to localization of the software, documentation production and other things, too.  For instance, the libreoffice.org website is set up so that NL teams can develop their own NL site with total independence from the English site, as regards structure (\"information architecture\") and page content.  NL teams are not at all obliged to follow a \"translation-based\" approach to either documentation or their NL site. If they feel that their particular community is better served by developing their own content, they are free to do so.  As regards localization of the software, obviously NL teams are going to be translating the English strings into their own language. But there are various tools and workflows one could use for that translation process and, here again, NL teams have total freedom of choice: you could do it online with Pootle, or offline with OmegaT or Poedit, or simply using an appropriate text editor, to name but *some* of the possibilities.  For instance, in the English documentation team, we're about to start evaluating Alfresco (I've now got a sandbox site set up, by the way, and we can start on assessing that anytime from this week onwards). But that doesn't impose any obligations on NL teams to follow in our footsteps.  Of course, some NL teams might adopt a translation-based approach for their resources (documentation, NL site, LibreOffice help, wiki content, ...). In this case, TDF has all the facilities you need for that, and the English docs team already has a quantity of high-quality documentation that you can translate (we're working on producing much more, too).  My personal experience with machine translation is that it *can* be a time saver in certain very particular cases. But it does not work at all well with most of the content we have to deal with. The quality of results also varies according to the target language, and the effort that has been put into developing the translation memory. Current translation systems usually use a statistical approach rather than a rule-based approach, and I can tell you with mirth and glee that human translators are *not yet* close to being replaced by computers. :-D  To summarize about machine translation: it can end up giving you more work than if you translate manually, especially if you care about *quality*. Usually best avoided.  When you're thinking \"internationalization\" in the LibreOffice community, we have a \"native language\" paradigm rather than a nationality-based approach. For instance, the French NL community services all the French-speaking countries and communities (parts of Belgium, parts of Canada, France, various countries in Africa, ...). For English, we service Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the US and various other places and communities (we don't yet have the resources to manage different varieties of English).  For India, you can well understand the reasons for this thinking.  Only in marketing are things somewhat different. Marketing is much more country- and region-based. This is because there are notable differences between the context in, for instance, the UK and the context in the US. Indeed, marketing can address markets that englobe other national/community markets - that's the case in Europe, for example, with the EU being one marketing target in addition to the national states it contains.  Well, that turned into quite an essay! :-D  HTH. ;-)  David Nelson  "

I have built the idea from the documentation workflow that Jean proposed we use from the OOoAuthors site, including an editing and review process for every proposed change regardless of language.  I am not sure what direction language teams have taken regarding documentation and if this proposal fits in with any existing plans, could someone comment on this?  I would appreciate feedback to the open questions at the end of the document, if you have a constructive opinion, I am more than happy to adapt the approach if something is more appropriate / better outcome.  Thanks all for the positive input and support so far with the Documentation Team. Michael Wheatland  "

I had a quick look at it.  2010/12/26 Michael Wheatland :  To answer some of your open questions:  We should also have a look at pootle, since Sophie is running a test to use it for translation purposes (see her announcement here: http://go.mail-archive.com/Hn9qvZS2yGYyXSWq7P0JtElbvo0=> ). Pootle is a tool, that is known to many translators, so it might be useful to take it into account as well. We'll see what the result is of this test.  Btw, I'm not sure, that Jean recommended using the Wiki for developing the documentation. I would say it was more the opposite. :)  I would like to have a common template among all the languages, so I'm in favour of this idea.  For having the same structure: I think, the headings are chosen to have a logical layout and flow of the text. So in my opinion, it would make sense to have a similar structure in the other languages as well. But I would not force other language teams to have the same structure. Maybe there is a good reason, why they want to change it.  So I'll stop here for now - if I have more to say, I'll send another mail. ;)  Sigrid  "

For my part, I've set-up an Alfresco web at https://documentation.traduction.biz, and I'll be proposing this to the docs team for evaluation and testing. I'll be making an announcement about that within 24 hours.  I'm hoping that it will be administered by Ron Faile and - if she's willing to take part in this experiment - Jean Weber. I'll be getting more involved in it after January 10 2011, because I'm currently busy on re-theming the libreoffice.org website and further developing the content there, and will be presenting the site to the SC on that date.  If, after this evaluation, it happens that Alfresco is seen as a useful working tool for the LibreOffice docs team, I'll be asking Florian and Christian if they can give us an Alfresco web on the TDF/Ooodev De server, because LibreOffice working resources should ideally be hosted and operated on TDF-run infrastructure.  So it will be interesting to compare the two options side by side and see which is seen as a preferred working platform.  David Nelson  "

I have heard great things about Plone, very powerful and fast content management framework, but as I understand it there is a lot of custom coding involved.  Did the original conversation about Plone discuss how we would implement the workflow? Having the discussions with Jean early on regarding the infrastructure, I was under the understanding that the instance of Plone setup on OOoAuthors did not have a structured workflow, but rather folders with permissions. The discussions we have had so far is pointing towards structured cross-language collaboration, so as we have discussed previously, the tooling should meet the workflow needs rather than the other way around.  I am very keen to see Alfresco up and running, as we have discussed a few times. The Alfresco framework ties in very well with Drupal and together they provide an incredibly powerful document management system. I think someone pointed out the limitation of cross-language collaboration (I might be wrong here, I have not personally had experience with Alfresco in a multi-language environment).  Also, might I suggest that we refrain from using the TDF servers as a testing ground as this may lead to a misconception that we have decided on using the tool for the documentation workflow. The intermediate workflow, on the wiki, as discussed seems to be working quite well at the moment, albeit without permissions.  Thanks, Michael Wheatland  "

        "text": "Hi Michael, :-)  Thanks for this input and creative thinking. Objective examination of contrasting ideas is a great way to identify the best way forward.  I've read your presentation and sat there thinking about your ideas, but I don't think we hit the jackpot yet. Let me explain why.  1) Your system sees documentation and other i18n-able content being processed within a unified work process. You yourself alluded to the complexity of such a system. I see that as a problem because a) it will take quite some time and considerable development work to implement, and b) it will impose a degree of technical expertise and a learning curve on i18n and English docs people that might be beyond many.  2) Your system deprives i18n teams/individuals of the current flexibility and freedom of action that is one of the founding principles behind TDF. They would be obliged to work as \"minions\" (said with a *big* *humorous* smile) of a \"big machine\" that does not let them address and implement any NL-specific needs and approaches.  We have to bear in mind that i18n is done by teams ranging in size from one solitary individual to a number of contributors, and they have varying degrees of technical expertise, as well as varying degrees of willingness to learn new systems that would get imposed on them. IMHO, by offering people total freedom of action, but backed up by a good level of support if they want to adopt existing workflows, tools and content, we are likely to draw-in a lot more contributors ot the community of communities.  To better explain what I mean, I refer you to my recent post explaining TDF's i18n policy, such as I have come to understand it (see [1]).  My humble suggestion would be to keep thinking, but focus on a workflow for the English documentation team. If we really come up with something that is a real winner, it is likely to be naturally adopted by at least *some* i18n teams. But, IMHO, a \"standardized\", \"global\", \"factory\" approach is unlikely to win widespread support.  While you're thinking, I'd invite you to evaluate the current options up for discussion:  1) Andreas Mantke's and Jean Weber's work on their Plone-based web;  2) The Alfresco evaluation sandbox I've got installed at https://documentation.traduction.biz which might work for the \"English docs\" team and for any i18n teams interested in collaborating closely with \"English docs\", whether on a \"translation-based\" approach or on an \"own content creation\" approach (or a mixture of the two);  3) A wiki-based approach;  3) Any other system you see as advantageous (which I am betting would be Drupal-based :-D ).

I am proposing this for evaluation by the English documentation team, and any interested i18n people, as one option among the other possibilities presently under consideration:  1) using the Plone-based web currently primarily operated by Jean Weber, with technical support from Andreas Mantke;  2) using the TDF wiki, as is now the case.  I won't have much time for this before January 10, due to other work I'm doing.  My suggestion would be that Jean Weber could be an admin on the Alfresco site, and that we could try processing 1, 2 or 3 chapters of the Writer Guide on it, to see what Alfresco's merits and weaknesses are. (I had hoped Ron Faile would also be another admin, but I think he's busy on the core work of the docs team - producing documentation.)  If ever Alfresco was seen as a possible viable tool after initial evaluation, I would ask Florian and Christian if they could set us up an Alfresco installation on the TDF server infrastructure, which is the natural place for a tool used by the LibreOffice English docs team. Any data already accumulated by that time could be migrated by Christian with full support from me. So we can start actually doing useful work on the https://documentation.traduction.biz web any time from now on, without any wastage of collaborative effort.  I will be doing some work on my Alfresco sandbox myself, but it won't be much of an evaluation of its collaborative capabilities if no-one else does some actual documentation work there. So I would encourage other active docs team members to ask me for an account there and try it out, even if your predispositions are leaning towards other options. ;-)  And I would then invite you to center your Alfresco-related discussion mainly on *this* thread, so we can pool our ideas and reactions.

Also this has been removed but I believe it should be noted somewhere because that will brake the extensions database for the users who want to downgrade to a OOo 3.2 version : The Berkeley database engine has been upgraded in this version of ${PRODUCTNAME}. The database engine upgrade introduces an incompatibility with user data for installed extensions for ${PRODUCTNAME} versions prior to 3.2 that may require your action if you downgrade your version of ${PRODUCTNAME}. This version of ${PRODUCTNAME} will convert your extension database to the new Berkeley database format when extensions are installed or removed. After this conversion, the database can no longer be read by earlier versions of ${PRODUCTNAME}. Downgrading to an earlier version may result in a dysfunctional installation. If you downgrade to an earlier version of ${PRODUCTNAME}, you must remove the user data directory {user data}/uno_packages, for example ~/.openoffice.org/3/user/uno_packages, and reinstall all extensions.

I hadn't thought of it as a possible tool for the LibreOffice docs team, but I will keep your words in mind when I start getting properly into Alfresco in the early days of the New Year. Although it doesn't have the workflow development capabilities that could be useful... Like you say, Dropbox is a very simple and practical tool for a small team with good communication and cooperation habits.  Right now, I see Alfresco as something with much more potential, plus it has the plugin for OOo/LibO that allows more-direct integration into the suite. That could give us the ability to develop a sophisticated workflow control while making the contributor's hands-on experience quite simple and transparent.  In any case, I'm looking forward to taking a few chapters of the Writer Guide or developing some chapters of a Calc or Impress guide, so that we can properly see Alfresco in action.

I don't in any way want to be \"control freak\"-ish, and I certainly want to give you the ability to actively contribute to the development of a docs workflow. Maybe you can also help evaluate the possible potential for integration of i18n work, too.  Can I just take this chance to suggest some working rules for us, as regards the Alfresco site?  First of all, let's think of this Alfresco site like this:  I originally had it set-up with the idea that it gives the LibO docs team an opportunity to evaluate Alfresco.  *If* the team likes it and *if* there is serious uptake, there would be two ways to go:  a) We get Florian and Christian to set up an Alfresco installation on the Ooodev De server infrastructure, and we migrate the whole thing over there, with all the developed workflows and all the accumulated docs and data. This would be my preferred solution, but I'm not sure if I will then have OS access via SSH to do any maintenance necessary. That would depend on Florian's and Christian's ideas on the subject.  b) If those guys don't have much time for that, or if they decide they don't want to take on the maintenance of an Alfresco installation, we *could* keep using the current installation at https://documentation.traduction.biz *if* the SC decides that they prefer to assign a libreoffice.org sub-domain instead. In this case, I would re-configure my Apache server accordingly, and we would stay where we are; just the domain name would change: documentation.libreoffice.org, or something like that.  If a) then the current Alfresco install is going to revert to me for my own future professional usage.  If b) then the current Alfresco install is going to be our future working tool.  In either case, we should not think of this Alfresco as an expendable sandbox in which we can do \"quick-and-dirty\" things. ;-) We should *try* not to break anything (although if we do, I can get things fixed very quickly via the paid technical support I have). ;-) And we all need to *RTFM* before attempting things. :-D  This being said, a tool is no good unless you can do things with it, so do go for it.  But let's talk about things on the list beforehand, so that everyone is aware of what's going on, and we can be sure that we're not working at cross-purposes with each other.  While we're developing workflows for the site, and re-configuring things, it would be a really good idea to *document* what we develop, for future reference.  I haven't discussed the idea with Hal yet, but I hope that he's going to act as our \"lead admin\", especially during the next couple of weeks - but even after that, too. He's investing time in learning Alfresco, and his work for LibreOffice is entirely focussed on docs. Plus he's an experienced technical writer. So, if he accepts the idea, he's our anchorman for all Alfresco site admin. In that case, he should be *kept informed* about how the site is developed.  I also suggest that we invite Michael Wheatland and Jean Weber to become site admins.  Michael has ideas for developing possible docs and i18n workflows, and it would be interesting to see how they could maybe work on an Alfresco platform. At the very least, there can be an interesting interaction of ideas.  Jean has said she is taken up with administering her Plone-based web. But I think it would be interesting for her to be able to get a look behind the scenes at Alfresco, for the development of her own project, and maybe to feed back about differences of approach. I see her access as purely \"passive\". The ability to look around, but without actually \"touching\" anything.  By the way, if any Alfresco discussions look like developing into a big conversation of their own, I suggest you just spin-off a new thread, and include \"ALFRESCO\" in the subject line.  What do you think about all this, guys?  David Nelson  "

This note is going to be a bit of a ramble as I write down my thoughts.  Under Company Home there are Spaces (including User Homes, Sites, and Web Projects, among others), and there can be Content Items directly under Company Home. Dumping all the user guide docs into Company Home as Content Items doesn't seem like a good idea, especially if there will be several languages on the site. It seems to me that, at a minimum, we should collect the files into groups (folders, whatever) for specific books.  It looks like one approach might be to create new Spaces, either one for each book, or one for each language with second-level Spaces for each book, or something similar. Since I have Admin access, I don't know if this function is available to others with ordinary user access, but it's probably best done by admins anyway.  Does anyone know enough about this thing to offer some insight, instead of me just blathering away with speculations? I plan to go away and do some reading to try to answer my own questions about how. Or I suppose I could go ahead and create a Space and see what I can do with it.

The site should motivate the visitor to use or at least try LibreOffice and it should motivate people to become an active supporter of the community.  In this sense http://www.libreoffice.org/ is already doing a fairly good job, mostly due to your contribution.   If John Doe then looks at the installation instructions, he might probably be deterred again. It looks terribly complex and difficult. Primarily we should clarify, that installation usually is very, very simple. (By the way, actually a lot easier and faster than MS Office!) For special and specific cases we have of course detailed support articles...   IMO there is no need to edit and keep these support articles in the CMS. The wiki is just the right place.  For example, the german Ubuntu Users Community has best experiences with http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de. Their only place for support articles is the wiki. The wiki has a much lower barrier for potentially contributing authors and thus ubuntuusers.de has a tremendous high number of competent users, who share their knowledge and experience via the wiki.  For installing LibreOffice, average users in the very most cases wont need any instructions at all. Windows users will just do a double-click to start the self-explaining installer, just as they are used to from any other software. Mac users will drag&amp;drop it to the applications folder, just as they are used to from any other software. Most Linux Users will install it from the repository of their distribution, just as they are to from any other software. Some Linux experts may choose another way, but these users are skilled anyway.  There surely remains a little percentage of special cases, where the user needs more information or support for installing. But this little percentage does not justify a prominent place for detailed documentation on the website, that carries the danger and gives the impression that installing LibreOffice is a cumbersome affair.

Alfresco will require a little bit of documentation-reading, but it's a useful expertise to acquire these days, when online team collaborative experience is quickly becoming a wanted skill (IMHO).

I'm putting together a full Getting Started book so Friends of OpenDocument Inc can have a printed copy available for display at their table at the linux.conf.au Open Day at the end of January.  Do you think we should make this book available for sale to the general public (through FoOD's store at Lulu.com), or wait until all the chapters have been updated and declared published? I can easily replace the book's interior PDF with a new one when the officially published book is ready.  While I am working on the book, I am discovering the occasional item that needs to be changed. I don't have time to make the changes as I go, so I'm reporting some of them here on the list, including some that might be considered enhancements rather than corrections. When I've finished with publishing the book, I intend to go back to the chapter files and make the changes, if someone else hasn't already done so.  Why, you might ask, am I not making the changes in the chapter files and using the master document to recompile an up to date book? The full book has two serious problems left over from its incarnation as an OOo book: a selection of buggered-up cross-references, and a bunch of pictures that go missing when the PDF is created. Both problems can be solved after exporting the master document to an ODT, removing the links to the chapter files (thus embedding the contents of those files in the ODF), and deleting (not just hiding) the copyright and TOC pages in the chapter files.  At some point, we (and/or the OOo Docs team) need to do something to clean up these files so they behave themselves, but that will be a major project that we don't have time for right now.  Hal  "

I'm about the closest thing there is to a docs team lead at present, batting for LibO.  I'm interested in working up an internal flow and organization for LibO documentation, and I recently set up an Alfresco server for that at https://documentation.traduction.biz. There are currently about 8 docs team members with accounts there. If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you an account there, too.  There's not much happening on Alfresco yet. This is certainly because it's new and I haven't had time to lead the way and start a tangible work project there yet. I'm busy with other work until the 10th, so it will happen shortly after that.  After that, it depends on whether docs contributors start taking it up as a tool. If they do, then either that Alfresco system will get integrated into the TDF Web infrastructure, or another Alfresco will be set up and there will be a migration of workflow and data.

Major revisions are being deferred until later; at this point we just want to get books ready as quickly as possible.

We could also have different renditions made up to suit different people's needs or interests (for new users; wordprocessing users; calc users; business oriented users; database users etc. )  If we could categorise these and advertise them on our site it may prove to be of help to some.  I will leave a copy of this post on the marketing list and see if anyone would be interested in picking up the idea. I will also make a note of this in the \"ideas\" section of marketing.[2] In this case, I don't think we could call this a promotional idea but more of a tool to the distro.

Click the Browse button and select the file you've been working on. I usually select Documentation and EN for categories and CC, LGPL and MPL for the license. Then click Upload file. You'll see it at the top of the revision list once the upload is complete. :)  When you download a file and edit it, be sure to leave the filename as is.

The Workflow.png flowchart, a document which details our workflow (certainly a working document at this stage of the game - less so as it gets dialed in), A document which details information about the project such as 1) Who is primary stakeholder, 2) Goal of completion, 3) etc... and perhaps another document which gives a list of links to further help such as to the Power User's guide, maybe the irc.freenode.net address...   I'm sure the primary producers of documentation so far have a better idea than I of what would be handy to have instant access to, consolidated in one space, for every work space they could be involved in. The idea is to 1) Make it obvious and easy to someone just joining how they can be of use, and 2) Once the user is underway, keep them from clicking all about looking for different pieces of a puzzle.  And if I'm on the right track here, I wonder when would be a good time to rework http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development to 1) remove our current workflow and matrix, and 2) briefly explain how we use Alfresco, add a link to the site and a request for the user to get in touch with Hal or other to get a sign-in setup.

For those of you who want to help me with screenshots, can we please follow these bases *exactly*, so that we get a uniform set of shots that don't spoil the site design? (I am starting my shot-taking now, and won't be re-doing it again, so this is the way the shots on the site are going to be for the moment.)  I have decided to adopt 1000px by 750px for the window size when taking the shot. (Under Ubuntu, you can easily use \"Screen Ruler\" for accurately sizing the window. The actual graphic shown on the pages will be downsized.)  I am going to use screenshots taken under Ubuntu with the default Ambiance theme (with *no* visual effects activated).  Reminder:  I need some more sample files with which I can produce screenshots for the libreoffice.org, from *all* the LibO apps.  If you have LibO files (from Writer, Calc and Impress) that contain attractively-presented content that is not copyrighted, please mail them to me ASAP.  If you have any well-presented equations for Math, I need some more too.  Similarly, if you have any databases for Base with well-peopled tables, and with forms and reports, I need them, too.  Or, if you feel able to help out by taking screenshots yourself, then:  a) Take them under Ubuntu Linux, using the Ambiance theme, with *no* visual effects.  b) Take the *window only* with the window frame - not the whole desktop.  c) 1000px wide by 750px tall - you can use Screen Ruler to accurately size the window.  e) Anything up to a dozen good shots from each app is what I'm hoping to accumulate.... in each app, demo the key features: in Writer, tables, indexes, etc..... I'm sure you see what I mean....  f) The file you use for taking the screenshot should ideally be called \"sample.odt\" (or whatever extension)  I'll be working on this today Sunday, Jan 9, and tomorrow Monday, Jan 10. I'll be able to use all your contributions that comply with the above and that arrive within these 2 days.  Please mail your contributions directly to me. ;-)  A big thanks for any help. ;-)  P.S. If you're not posting specifically about the work I'm talking about on this thread, please post under another thread and do not go OT here. Thanks for you kind understanding about this.

So, people are increasingly less likely to need to mess around with tarballs or  anything trickier than a 3 click install.  Many other distros are just waiting  for the proper release of LO.

A user uploads a new file to the Drafts folder. Someone checks out the file from the Drafts folder to begin editing. The file stays in the Drafts folder and is marked that it is checked out and to show which user is working on it. If possible, prevent other users from editing the file while it is checked out.  Step 2.  The user downloads the file, makes changes and then uploads the file to Alfresco and checks the file back in. The user is then offered the option to either leave the file in the Drafts folder if the file needs further editing or if editing is complete, move the file to the next step in the process, the Review folder.  Step 3.  Another user goes to the Review folder and checks out the file, downloads it and reviews it. If the file was revised, it would be moved back to the Drafts folder and the document is checked back in. If it was ok and ready to proceed to proofing, the file is moved to the Proofing folder and the file is checked in.  Step 4.  A user goes to the Proofing folder, downloads the file and proofs it. If the file needs more work, it is moved back to the Drafts folder. If they agree it is ready for publishing, they go to the Proofing folder and mark that the file is ok. The file is marked as having been proofed once. Then a second user proofs the file and if they agree it is ready to be published, they mark that they have proofed the file and it is ok. Once the file has been proofed by two users, then it will be moved to the Published folder.  I agree about turning on auto-versioning. Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks.  Ron   "

The story was a user phoned tech-support and had trouble with everything they  said.  They finally said \"and now just open the window\" which resulted in  silence from his end, some footsteps and then bird-song.  Also with something too generic (such as windows) there is a danger of  contravening copyright or even just totally confusing people if the word is used  at the beginning of a sentence.   I'm happy with \"dialog\", it's close enough to what i prefer and specific enough  to mean something.

The problem with pop-ups is that there really are so many different kinds and  they do sometimes need to be distinguished between.  I have never heard the terms \"pop-up menu\" or \"pop-up window menu\" and they  sound like things that could appear anywhere and usually done with a normal  mouse click (left button usually).  The only things i have ever seen that could  be referred to in those terms are really called a \"drop-down\" or a \"drop-down  list\".  Its possible that some people use \"drop-down menu\" but again i haven't  heard it.     Although it sounds mad I think it's important to have terms that we don't use in  the glossary so that people can find out what the correct term is.  In this case  the correct term is \"drop-down\" or \"drop-down list\".  While a \"drop-down list\" appears when people use the left-click - the \"context  menu\" (or the older and grammatically incorrect \"contextual menu\") appears with  a right-click.  Since the action to get the menus/lists are quite different the distinction  between the names is quite important.  Also many people are being taught about  computers to quite a high level without ever learning that a right-click menu  exists!  People get amazingly distressed about not knowing when to use a single-click and  when to use a double-click and i have even heard someone bitterly ranting about  a triple-click (for selecting a whole paragraph) as though it makes computers  impossibly difficult to understand and far beyond the capabilities of anyone.     Being VERY clear about which button to click by simply using the correct term in  the correct place is very important to such hopeless people.  @ Sophie.

My basic rationale was that dialog box was more widely used by most of the major software/firmware/hardware developers over the past two decades, including Microsoft, Sun Microsystems--the previous sponsor of OOo, Motorola, Red Hat, IBM, among numerous others.  When working as a technical editor of user guides for (embedded-microcontroller) compilers, assemblers, IDEs, etc. over at the newly branded spinoff of Motorola--Freescale Semiconductor--during 2005, I was directed to follow its corporate style guide, which strictly mandated its use over dialog (no exceptions were allowed, as with many other corporate style guides, such as guides for those firms listed above).  Also, the Wilkipedia has dialog box in lieu of dialog (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_box). The Wiki tends to employ the more accurate nomenclature for most GUI components. If one follows the Wiki forms, then agreement can be more universal. [Hint: If one does not like whatever form the Wiki employs--change (edit) it...] Some editors prefer dialog for one reason or another; others consider the use of dialog to be flawed, lazy, or sloppy usage. Oracle tends to employ both forms...  Another area of disagreement is in the use of \"tabbed page\" or \"tabbed window\" versus a \"tab.\" A tab is the part of the GUI component on a tabbed window/page that a user selects for accessing the desired page/window, much like a small tab on an index card in an older paper-based filing system. The page/window itself contains the bulk of that document's information, but not the small projection (tab).  There are others.   Gary   "

Doing some pro bono (they gave me expensive embedded-microcontroller firmware-development apps to use for free) technical-editing work for Motorola in the very late 1990s/early 2000s, I used each form, depending upon which O/S the particular IDE apps used.  So, another consideration is to employ the term based upon the particular O/S hosting the office suite.   Gary  "

The vocabulary is pretty specific, and people on Mac don't generally refer to Taskbar, Drawer, etc. Ever since OSX came into being, the UI has remained essentially unchanged, so those specific terms are all understood by Mac users.  I agree, however, that completely rewriting the documentation / guides, etc, just to take into account the specificities of Mac vocabulary is not a route that I am going to go down. If Larry wants to make Mac specific guides just for that platform then he is quite welcome to do so as far as I'm concerned :-))   Alex   "

I checked out two documents (Introducing Writer), made minor edits to them, and then checked-in (and so uploaded) new versions of them.  One of them had been in the drafts \"folder\". I approved the checked-in version and it moved to the feedback \"folder\". The other one was already in the publish folder and, when I approved it, it then moved to the \"test FIN\" folder. I could see that Ron Faile has also been working on a document there.  I can see that this is a big, big step forward in relation to our current wiki-based workflow. Plus we have not yet started using the versioning available within Alfresco. There are a lot of other features that would be very valuable to the docs work process, too: the discussion feature, and the advanced workflow features. We have but scratched the surface.  @Jeremy: It would be great if you could make sure that this is visible to everyone.  @Ron: What do you think about this, Ron?  @Samphan: What do you think about this, Samphan? Is this in line with what you envision? Where do we go from here?  @All: It would be great if all you guys can jump in and do test edits on the docs in that space. Remember that these are *not* as yet true working copies that we'll be publishing for our users. They are just test versions as \"dummy content\" for Alfresco testing. So don't feel afraid to experiment and learn with them. (If they are still in usable condition when we have finished testing, then we will use them as drafts when we subsequently get to launch an operational workflow for live work.)  Great work, Jeremy. ;-) I'm still busy on the libreoffice.org site, but I will take time out to start properly RTFM in just a couple of days now.  I'm getting excited about Alfresco.

Right now, documentation is being sourced from oooauthors.org and adapted to the LibreOffice team's needs for LibreOffice. So, if that oooauthors.org content contains Mac-specific info, it will be preserved.  But, IMHO, when the LibreOffice team has its own dedicated working resources, and when the OOo/LibO disributions start to diverge, and when the LibreOffice team starts work on the manuals that are currently completely unwritten, I'd guess we'll be developing our own documentation independently. I'd guess that this will happen in the fairly near future...  At that time, we'd need some Mac users on the team to get involved and help us provide content that is OK for the Mac community... You could, for instance, post-edit drafted documentation and augment it with Mac-related content (shortcut tables, etc.).
