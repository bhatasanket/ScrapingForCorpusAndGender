I still have various full offline backups in case anything got missed, and will keep them for some time to come.  My next task will be to work on updating the Contributor's Guide and Jeremy's original Alfresco Boot Camp, so that people can familiarize themselves with using Alfresco.  Now, all documents (.odt, .pdf, etc.) have proper thumbnails of the cover page, and can be fully previewed and read online without even having to download them. All meta data is displayable for each document and can be updated from the Alfresco interface (this includes renaming the actual files). The changes to meta data get written within the document.  There is also a simple workflow implemented for the documentation team, which I'll be documenting in the contributor docs.  Anyone who wants to start working on documentation can do so without problem. For the moment, I'd recommend liaising with me on this list before moving anything around - perhaps you can consider to be the team's librarian until such time as we have updated contributor docs and have \"finalized\" things.  All questions and comments are very, very welcome. There's lots of stuff that can be modified if you want.  Anyone who had an account on the old Alfresco platform will need a new account creating. Just give a heads-up on the list, and it will be done very quickly.  "

Other work we would have available would be rebranding documents and - optionally - replacement of screenshots. For this I could point you at various docs.  The rebranding work does not involve factual checking, just formatting basically. We have a guide that would explain the approach for that, Do you feel that might be within spec for you?  You could usefully have a look in the \"Repository> English> Documentation> Resources> Draft\" section and read the re-branding guide and the guide to producing documentation. Then you could probably better assess what you feel able to take on.  Would that be OK?  "

We still don't have a guide for Base although that is a very tough challenge, perhaps even impossible at this point.   Guides to help people that are new to the documentation list have been a very low priority because building-up infrastructure has been more urgent. Now that we have moved to the upgraded Alfresco it might be good to work on guides for people joining the documentation team. A fresh perspective from someone new to the list might be good.

Obviously, the document will need further review from a technical viewpoint, to validate the accuracy of the content in respect of our current versions of LibreOffice.   OK, no problem here. Obviously, the work you've done is a first pass in massaging the guide into a usable form for us.   This is a point that will need the above-mentioned technical validation. There are many filenames (and paths) that have not changed, even though the devs could easily have re-named them. This is often to preserve compatibility with past versions of OpenOffice.org, so that users don't find themselves with something suddenly broken after upgrading to a more-recent version.  But no worries, we have the changes tracking turned on and can easily roll back this kind of thing if it proves necessary. :-)   No worries there. Re-working a guide such as this one is an incremental process, and that work will be done in a next pass.

Also there is a wish-list of what people would like the Docs Team to do http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Production#Wish_List_for_User_Documentation and there si a beginning of a \"community Documentation\" section that could use a bit of tidying and adding to http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/HowTo  Screen-shots are generally to be taken in Gnu&amp;Linux, preferably Ubuntu, with a specific theme but since the wiki pages are easier to edit to remove 'wrong' images it's possibly ok to use screen-shots any which way you like. We want to try to keep the printable User Guides as reasonably consistent as possible but wiki pages don't matter so much. At least, that's my opinion.  I think it might be great if we could help Danishka do \"scalar vector graphics\" screen-shots to possibly replace the ones in the current guides but only for the books in his/her project for school/college books.

PS : I installed the deb packages and everything was ok (media not found but no pb with them), so I don't understand 39391 (moreover it has been marked as a blocker) except if I'm the only one \"WORKSFORME\" PS2 : I know I crosspost with dev mailing list but it could be interesting for more than 1 mailing list    "

That might help us avoid falling behind if there are substantial changes. It would help if whatever documentation we link to is editable (like our wiki-pages rather than a blog) so that we could help there update there documentation a bit if something extreme happened. Perhaps give links to the \"community documentation\" provided by a couple of the major distros?   I think it does make sense to cover the basics and perhaps any likely problems that might typically happen with LO (if there are any) but avoid getting too deeply into documenting it?

When I originally re-worked the Linux readme and the Linux installation instructions, I especially had in mind the idea of providing comprehensive instructions for inexpert users.  But covering Linux in such instructions is more complicated than other operating systems, because of the multiple distributions that need to be covered.  However, I have to admit that the resulting installation guides and the readme probably constitute as much of a barrier to easy installation for a newbie as the complexity (for a newbie) of a command-line installation process.  So a re-working is definitely necessary. What we currently have is rather \"spaghetti code-like\", especially after all the comments at the time were worked into the drafts.  "

I think that one might be best split into a few short sub-pages such as  Debian Ubuntu &amp; other Debian family distros Mageia / Mandriva and family Redhat family distros openSUSE distros Slackware Arch Many of those are probably about the same anyway.   On the main page something generic such as \"As Root User do ... \" and then later a \"Now as normal user ... \". I think the only differences between the distros is the file ending (either rpm or deb ie requires yum or dpkg or apt-get) and whether the distro has the \"sudo\" command by default to avoid needing to use \"su\" or logging in as Root. Hmm, that does suddenly look complicated but it's really not as bad as i made it sound i'm sure!   Regards from Tom :)   -"

I did finish a somewhat quick single-pass edit of Chapter 10, though but did not upload it to my website yet. The nags on the administration control panel on the phpBB3 forum site kept urging me to update to the latest version over the past several days, so I did that software updating first yesterday.  Chapter 10 had over 150 edits made to it. I suspect that the original source file from OOo was responsible for most, if not all, of those errors--not the rebranding efforts. The only LO-caused problem that I can remember was related to its not being updated for version 3.4 yet--a screenshot had a version 3.3 name for a dialog-box title. (Somebody should fix that, though...)  Because the OOo source file for Chapter 10 contained so many errors due to, perhaps, careless lapses, mostly with improper character formatting and manual overrides, I reckon that all of the remaining OOo Writer Guide chapter files used in rebranding might have been similarly \"contaminated.\"  I would prefer not having to perform all of those tedious copyediting repair jobs myself for those several other chapters, so maybe some volunteers might help out. No experience would be necessary, as I can readily instruct each and everybody in how to perform the copyediting and technical editing tasks that are necessary.  The edited chapter 10 (edit-tracked and commented) source file could be employed for giving general and specific instructions in how to carry out the many repetitious editing changes necessary in order to bring the LO chapter source files up to more-professional standards.  In any event, I will load the edited Chapter 10 source file onto my forum site soon and will include mucho exposition there also--relating to what was done in greater detail.   Gary    "

That is primarily why I will conduct it online on the forum site instead of having it buried under the rug and unused at LO docs or elsewhere.  I am on the OOo docs email list also as you, so we both clearly know that OOo docs is getting a fair number of recent volunteers--such as OOo getting a new volunteer right before I am posting this message, whereas LO is not receiving many such new volunteers, for what that is worth. OOo docs appears to be promoting itself much better effectively relative to LO docs--even though you have appealed to some new OOo volunteers recently over at OOo docs to entice them to come over to this side of the aisle also.  Anyway, I will continue to post the original (improperly edited) LO source file and the edited LO source file for Chapter 10 on the forum site and then add the exposition that indicates the specific areas of sloppiness and technical errors therein and how any technical-editor trainees, who might ever meander over there (from anywhere), should eradicate and remedy the errors.

I've noticed regular posts from supposedly prospective docs contributors, but not one of them has ever posted back a second time, which is kind of strange. In the past, here on the LibO docs ML, when people volunteer then you usually see follow-up activity and some kind of work contribution thereafter.   If you're planning to do something that's \"in parallel\" to the LibO docs effort, insofar as you don't contribute work via LibreOffice resources, and yet you produce derived content in respect of what's offered by the LibO project, then you might at least want to bear in mind the question of LibO's copyright and logo usage rules.

So the perceived promotion is an historical artefact. Essentially all of the people who send notes to OOo doc are not subscribed, and presumably when they receive TJ's response they read the info he send them to, and they decide (for whatever reasons) that it's not what they want... at least not during the current uncertainty over the future of Apache OOo docs. So it's not a \"spam thing\" and I don't find it strange at all that people don't follow up.  That said, David is right: people who enquire here have been more likely to contribute, however briefly. I assume that's because things actually are happening here and people can perceive that, even if they are confused about what to do, where to start, and so on.  --Jean  "

Please give us a bit of background here on yourself, your technical writing experience if any, other relevant experience and interests (spreadsheets? databases? word processing? whatever). That could help us suggest specific items for you to work on, or feel free just to pick anything that interests you. And also feel free to ask questions.

If you want to struggle with them some more, please use the files in the Drafts folder for the Draw Guide.  There are some other Draw screenshots that need improvement for better visibility and printing: the lines are too thin or the handles are too small or some other part of the image is too pale, or whatever. In some cases the lines, for example, may need to be artificially thickened for illustrative purposes. IMO fixing these substandard images would greatly improve the book.  Of course there are many other things to do (in all the books) in addition to screenshots. But if you particularly like doing them, the Impress Guide would benefit from many replacement pictures, because some visual elements have changed from v3.3.x to v3.4.x. Again, use the files in the Drafts folder (for the Impress Guide).

OOo would take eons in order to tackle many of their bugs, as newer bugs were likely piling up faster than their relatively few developers could fix them. LO seems to be a lot quicker. A case in point is LO's quick response to its first 3.4 release bug that would not handle edit tracking properly (where the copyedited deletions were not visible).  One problem with documentation when bugs are involved is that such documentation likely consists of workarounds--but these workarounds are not listed as being bug fixes. So, some documentation might not be accurate at some point in the future (or even needed) after any such bugs get fixed by the developers. IOW, the documents could contain much unnecessary (or possibly even nonfactual) material.  My take is that all documentation that involves known bug fixes should be disclosed as being bug fixes--even if doing that exposes the software suite to some criticism.  Gary    "

See the gap at the right-hand-side of http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Publications Smart eh?    Some people may continue to prefer to use the work-arounds given as part of the documentation for the 3.3.x branch even after a bug has been fixed in some cases.     If you really feel the need to identify which established ways of doing things are/were due to bugs and which are/were just an alternative way or even a main way of doing things then feel free.  I think Alfresco still has the folders ready for updating the older version of the documentation.  Personally i think it's better to keep moving forwards where possible rather than to back-track.    The OOo devs were often able to fix bugs and they submitted many patches and updates that had already been tested by the community but Sun often disdained to accept work done by non-employees (apparently).  That was part of the reason for forks such as Go-oo.  It was probably also part of the reason why so much was achieved so quickly with the code in early releases of LO when Go-oo and possibly others re-integrated with LO.  At least that's the impression i get after reading-up 3rd party accounts and hearing from a few disgruntled people that are much happier with LO under TDF than with anything under Sun.

Writers of documentation often include kludges to work around some bugs due to inadequate development of the software applications. No problem there, except... except when such kludges are not disclosed appropriately. When editing the Writer Guide starting in 2006, I might come across on occasion some esoteric empty paragraphs or extra spaces and some such in templates, master documents, or subdocuments--but at first I did not know just why they were there. They, in essence were temporary kludges included for workarounds to some OOo bugs--but there was little documentation, usually none, as to their purpose or even their existence.  The problem with employing kludges without documentation is that anybody having to maintain such templates, master documents, or subdocuments is most often not let into the \"secrets.\" One, much better way of employing documentation kludges is to append some very simple semi-permanent documentation that stays with the documents until the kludges are no longer needed (due to developers eventually fixing the code, etc.) and afterward they (both the kludge and its documentation) can be simply removed.  A simple manner of documenting a kludge would be to append a simple comment (Insert > Comment) to that segment of the document and simply keep it there indefinitely--until it is no longer needed--after the kludge is removed, hopefully. OOo and LO documenters do not seem to do that... It was our fault as \"sloppy\" technical editors and writers not to adequately disclose such esoterics.  So, in everything that I do involving any such kludges, I will append simple documentation disclosure, so that any of my works can be easily and readily maintained by third parties. I recommend that LO documenters do likewise.  Gary   "

(I do not know how you inferred that I favor keeping deadwood. Just the opposite.)  However, if (undocumented) kludges were a part of any current templates or other docs--such as any remaining artifacts carried forward from buggy versions 1 or 2 even, just how would you any anyone else delete them if, in fact, you were not even aware of their existence in the first place?  My point is that all such esoteric workarounds put into any document, template, or master document should be adequately disclosed, so that anybody maintaining or reviewing or editing those docs would know of their existence, their locations, their effects, their reasons for existence, and whether or not they are even needed any longer. If LO or OOo were to use any such mysterious kludges in the future, they should be appropriately documented. OOo (and LO) rarely ever disclosed their former kludges in a clear, consistent manner. That's all to my point.  The only good reason that a workaround would have been used in the past was to act as a temporary band-aid approach due to a bug being present. Bugs generally get fixed, so after the bugs are fixed, the kludges should be eliminated in favor of better writing or editing practices.  Gary    "

So, it's not necessarily a work-around.

It might be that perfect coding would involve a total re-write of the entire project but a work-around of just a few lines might give much the same result.

Well, Jean was the most likely editor who used them at OOoAuthors in order to get around a number of deficiencies with the master documents, mostly. The rub was that she rarely, if ever, disclosed them--unless somebody might tamper (remove) them inadvertently without realizing that they were \"features\" installed for some workaround or another.. Then, Jean might state that such-and-such was there for some workaround and that it should be left intact.  Other locations for some kludges might be on the title pages of the individual chapter files. Not disclosing them could \"break\" things, though, if other editors would work on such files without being aware of their presence.  A parallel in the computer-coding business is having a coder who might do things to enable \"job security.\" However, I am not including Jean into that kind of group. I was coming up with hints and suggestions for some future tutorials, and disclosing workarounds was just one of those suggestions. So, I brought it up here.  In any event, I am not against the use of kludges, as they often are the only way to accomplish some objectives with non-compliant applications--like the earlier versions of the quite buggy master documents in OOo. But, to be professional, those kludges really must be disclosed whenever they are employed.  'Nuff said... I came across a bit of obsolete material recently while technical editing the \"Working with Templates\" chapter. One subsection refers to installing the Template Changer, which is now preinstalled in LO. So, I remedied that. There is another area where a nonexistent command is documented. So, that subsection needs rewriting, as I left it for another volunteer to finish. Should be easy to finish, though. That chapter had not been modified at all in over eight months, so it needed work.  Perhaps, some volunteer writers who work with templates, like Jean and others, might add some input to that chapter, as she is writing a book on the subject, I think. I added some simple marginal notes in the chapter about some very minor ways to beef up the chapter. Also, a version 3.4 screen capture is needed. I will let others do the screenshots.  Another area is: writers who do not follow the formatting rules concerning paragraph and character styles in the template exposition. Using manual overrides (direct formatting) is a no-no.  Gary    "

This is not a full theme, but only the \"controls\" part. (If you press the Customize button you will notice that a theme is formed by Controls,   Colours, Window Borders, Icons and Pointers).

This is the windows borders part of the theme. It is 99% based on a theme I found on art.gnome.org, but I needed to modify the shade applied to the title (just removing a couple of lines from the XML file). 5) to finish the transformation, you can select Verdana as the font for the Window Titles. 6) save the new theme.

So, that can item wait until then.  I just carried over the arrow in OOoMenuPath, as I really do not read all the LO messages about getting rid of this or that and doing yet something else differently; effecting \"change\" is probably an edifice complex for some--not you, though. Things were OK before, and I reckon you too resisted much of those changes for change's sake at LO docs.  Formatting that arrow was a nuisance anyway--having to use two character styles for each text/arrow combo.  I made an effort to turn off AutoCorrect in my editing as it tends to turn things like OOo into Ooo. One heading paragraph style in the version 3.3 template has such a paragraph style name--likely an AutoCorrected term that was not caught. (I included that suggestion in the tutorial.) Some page-style names in the earlier 3.3 template exposition had such AutoCorrect errors too, I think.  And I suppose you kept (in the template exposition) the addition about making sure that all writers, reviewers, and editors see that all the typefaces used in LO docs are installed on their computers, lest some inadvertent changes not be introduced by not having all the appropriate fonts installed.  Anyway, in order to get a fair amount of variety in my editing tutorial, I have also included the version 3.4 template in order to ferret out any such items.

If you rename the \"3\" to todays date in reverse date order (eg for me, today it would be \"2011-10-24\") then it's easier to keep track of which profile back-up is the most recent.  LibreOffice is forced to generate an entirely new profile which sets LibreOffice \"back to factory defaults\".

Renaming the entire profile is a bit of a sledge-hammer approach, roughly equivalent to what most people expect from a re-install of the program, but it also works for sub-folders within the profile.    It's worth trying out the renaming and keep the lower-level folder open so that you can see the new \"3\" folder being created just by opening LO.    Often when people have problems with LO they can pin-point it to a specific file or sub-sub-folder within the user-profile and then simply revert to the factory default for that.

I am about halfway through that translation, but stalled it when I encountered various problems with Base at the time, i.e. before people like you, Lionel and Terry started working on the Base bugs ;-)  I guess now would be a good time to take that up again, if I can physically find the time to do so.  I know the German user mailing list is busy with preparing a German translation of the English Base user guide, but they have had to adapt/change quite a few bits because of the problems they encountered when using Base and when following the initial English getting started guide. I believe that Robert Grosskopf (regular Base user, bug reporter - at least on the German mailing lists) is heading up that translation effort, the aim, I think, is to post it to ODFAuthors once it is finished. AFAIK, the database example that they will provide with their Guide is completely different to the one proposed in the current English guide.    Alex   "

That's too much like a job, and I don't have time anyway.

Suggestions of what might work better could then be given by the team leader to the individual helpers.  Observation: It is very easy to reply \"+1\" to making a person the team leader to keep track of everything and everyone's progress. (Let someone else do it.) It is much harder to take on the responsibility of leading a specific topic area with persistence and diligence while only getting guidance from the team leader.  My experience with Jean's work goes back to OOo 1.1.x days. She does a wonderful job of guiding others. But she has had to do too many things for others that they were not willing to do for themselves. (She was the one to do the most important review of Getting Started with Base that someone else should have done.)  Maybe we need a need thread in which people volunteer to head the specific areas of LibreOffice. Perhaps this should be done first. Once we have leaders there, then might be a better time to have a team leader. After all, if we are truly a team, we ought to be doing our part.  These are my thoughts.  --Dan  "

MariaDB is to MySql as LibreOffice is to OpenOffice except that MySql is still owned Oracle so the relationship is not particularly friendly.  It is developing faster than MySql was allowed to.  It has almost all the original MySql people including the original people that started MySql in the first place.  It is a drop-in replacement for MySql.    MariaDb is a good back-end for corporate or large organisations that need a decent and hefty back-end.  It's probably a lot heftier than small clubs or individuals need for a little Contacts Mail-Merge List.  The MySql connector seems to work well with it.    Regards from Tom :)  -"

        "text": "Hi :) Ahhh, it's actually a LOT easier than that.    1.  You just register a user-name and login for yourself, just as you would with registering at a forum.  It's less tricky than setting up an email account such as gmail or yahoo.  I think there might be a 24hour delay before you get the confirmation email to your address but that email should help you login for the first time and change your password to something simple and short.    Sadly the wiki doesn't seem to allow really complicated passwords so stick to letters and maybe numbers but no \"funny characters\".  Experiment with the password after you have got the first one sorted out.    Hmm actually this password stuff is the really messy, clunky and confusing bit and it is probably that which is making the whole thing seem like a nightmare.  I had to use the password \"password\" (which is the most common and most hacked/cracked password out there) for quite a while before i was able to find something better that i could use &amp; remember.    2.  Once you have an account and have logged in and are at the page you want to edit it's much like just writing an email.  Once you have written what you want scroll down past all the language options, write a brief comment in the equivalent of the subject-line and click the appropriate button to \"submit\" changes.  The preview button can be a bit confusing at first so don't bother using it until you have made a few successful changes to a page.    3.  It is possible to use a type of mark-up language that does quite a few things that html would do but uses a different language called wiki-mark-up.  If you are fairly familiar with html it's easy.  If you're not it's still reasonably easy.  Either way it's worth leaving formatting for other people to do later until you have had a bit of practice at just getting plain text added a few times.    4.  There are pages that show what changes have been made recently throughout the wiki so if you make some stupid dumb mistake someone else can probably fix it.  Don't worry about making dumb mistakes everyone makes them especially while learning and most people are just happy to see someone new joining in and may even help with a couple of quick hints&amp;tips.   Good luck, have fun and don't worry!  Just add stuff and see how it goes :) Regards from Tom :)   -"

Although I don't consider Wikipedia a definitive source, it's always nice when it agrees with me. ;-)  I note this sentence in the Wikipedia article you cited: 'The correct way to write it in English is \"how-to\", but it is common practice to write it as \"HOWTO\" in the Linux community.' That explains to me why many people on this project are used to the all-caps version. However, the majority of LO's users are Windows users and, therefore, I assume most the readers of our documentation are Windows users; they are less likely to be familiar with Linux conventions.  Unfortunately, no style guide citation is given for the statement 'The correct way to write it in English is \"how-to\",' and I've been unable to find anything about this in a quick look through my style guides. Another possibility is to use \"how-to\" as an adjective, not a noun: for example, \"a how-to guide\" instead of \"a how-to\" or \"a list of how-to guides\" instead of \"a list of how-tos\".  --Jean  On Sun, Nov 6, 2011 at 06:36, Dennis E.

I think the nouning of it is typical English language vocabulary creativity.  One factor in being consistent, of course, is to assist translation.  I never saw HOWTO until I was looking up something on a Linux CD one time.  I had seen man pages for years before, of course.  Enough speculation!  Your mention of \"style guide\" reminded me that there is a Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications, though I don't know if it has been kept up.  I had to look at three wrong choices before I found it in my disorganized bookshelves.  It actually has \"how-to\" in the index.  Here is the Entry:     \"how-to vs. how to     \"   Hyphenate as an adjective (as in         'how-to books'), but use two words         as an adverb plus infinitive (as         in 'This is how to format your disk').     \"   In headings and titles, do not         capitalize the 't', as in 'How-tos,         Tips, and Tricks' or 'How to Format         Your Disk.' \"  Notice that they don't address nouning, but they use \"How-tos\".  (The so-called computer dictionary is worse.  Fortunately or unfortunately, the dictionary has no entries with title in the how* range.  Clearly Bill Gates did not proof-read any of this or some serious howlers would have been eliminated.  Bill is very astute concerning language and clarity.)  Citation:    Microsoft Corporation.  Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications, 2nd edition. Microsoft Press (Redmond WA: 1998).  ISBN 1-57231-890-2 pbk with CD-ROM.  Experimentation:  I thought I might try searching the CD-ROM version of the document. There is a Microsoft .chm version, but it's search treats \"how-to\" as two separate words.  Bummer. Ahah, they talk about \"readme files\" not \"read-me files\" but that is probably a typographical issue, since the name of the file is being referenced.  I suspect that is the ONLY case where \"howto\" is usable, as well as fully capitalized, when it is about files having a particular name or the application that coughs up such files (the howto command).  Laughs:  I tried running the install of the book on the CD-ROM using Windows 7 64-bit :).  The installer said it needed to install IE 4.0 in order to operate.  I declined.  It looked so 1990s too.

In txting, emailing, mailing-lists and so on it seems to be considered shouting so i think we should avoid it where possible.    My preference would be for how-to and read-me as adjectives, not nouns, in order to help mainstream pedants understand the documentation.  In titles i prefer How-To and Read-Me in order to be more consistent with other words written in Title Case.  Obviously some titles are all capitals and that is probably how HOW-TO and READ-ME started.

A lot of computer-savvy users know the term \"how-to\" and \"read-me\" and it would be good to introduce those terms to people that don't already know them.  Many terms are likely to crop-up elsewhere such as forums.  As an initial introduction and gateway into OpenSource programs such as LibreOffice (and Firefox) 'should' prepare people by introducing such terms.  Using existing widely used guidelines seems sensible unless they are under copyright or difficult to access or where they perpetuate inaccuracies or kludges.    For people who don't understand English as a 1st language we would hope that the official documentation gets translated into something they feel more comfortable with.  MTs (Machine translators) are sometimes hilariously wrong or inept.  Their output needs to be at least proof-read by a human being that understands implications and nuances of the target language.

Although some months ago my own feelings were that the LibO English docs team didn't really need a specific team leader, my opinion has somewhat evolved since then.  This is partly because of the small number (or even practical non-existence) of regularly active team members. New people have turned up, done some work and then become inactive again. People previously involved in OOo and ODFAuthors have sometime put in some work and then gone silent again - sometimes leaving their work in a half-finished state.  There are only a couple or so people with any accurate idea of the state of play of docs work and who's doing what, and Jean is one of them. Also, I have noticed how there is more general activity from other people when Jean herself is in an active period, and how things go largely dead when she's busy with other stuff in life.  So I do think it would be worth properly naming her team lead, because she does seem to carry a lot of weight with people and since it could give her a better position to be an ambassador for LibO documentation (for recruiting new members, for possibly finding alternative ways of getting documentation written for the project, etc.).  I'd see her as having more of an organizational/coordinating/project management role, and as being more of a \"librarian\" than anything else.  \"Possibly finding alternative ways of getting documentation written for the project\"?  Well, how about the possibility of getting commercial technical documentation and translation agencies involved in sponsoring/undertaking projects, in exchange for some form of publicity/creditation for their contribs? That would, of course, require some serious liaison and organization, and Jean would be a well-qualified candidate for the job (if she felt able to take on the role).  This is just one idea that comes to mind, but I'm starting to think that it's time to do some lateral thinking. The LibreOffice documentation effort has currently ground almost to a halt in terms of real productive work.  "

Further thought: If we don't yet have a wiki page where someone (not necessarily you) lists these issues as they come in (so we can track them), then we should set one up. People can then see what's needed and put their name down to work on it. Forwarding initial contact to list is important, but a tracking page on wiki is also needed.  My main questions are to do with how and where we write/edit help:  * In the Help files themselves? (If so, where?)  * By attaching a file (what format?) to the issue, so someone else can incorporate it in the help?  And what to do if someone on the Docs team finds Help that needs copyediting, enhancement, etc? Open an issue about it, attaching an edited/revised version? Edit the Help file directly?  Depending on the length and detail of the answer, this might become part of an existing chapter of the Contributors Guide, or it could be a chapter on its own. IMO it's very important to distinguish between how to work on the Help vs how to work on the user guides.  --Jean  "

There has been a project for a wiki-based help in the pipeline for a few months but, for the moment, the work still involves checking out the codebase from Git and editing files within it.   Hmmmmm, well, to obtain the content to edit, someone would have to procure it from Git. It would probably be simpler if a person wanting to work on the help files were to work on their own local copy.   I think the idea would be that someone working on one of the bug reports would come and discuss the resolution of the problem here on the ML with the rest of the team, or at least come and ask questions here when in doubt.   i think you're right that there should be a dedicated chapter on the subject, and that it's important to teach newcomers the distinction between documentation and the software's built-in help.  I'll take this on as a task to do along with revising the Alfresco content of the contributor docs.  Perhaps both subjects would merit writing-up on the wiki, too, but we should perhaps be careful about duplicating coverage because of the probable future emergence of conflicts in the info.

On Windows, right now, there is a problem with any software that deals with embedded fonts as there is an exploit that a carefully prepared ttf font can used to errr exploit.  Their method of dealing with the problem is to block parts of the programs that can handle embedded fonts.  So, it's better to get your own fonts for your own systems.    LibreOffice is immune as it doesn't embed fonts and Gnu&amp;Linux is immune because it doesn't use the same fonts parser.    Hopefully the whole problem might be sorted out in a couple of weeks.

If there are any questions about creating new help content, probably the best person to ask is Andras Timar. From what I understand, new entries require creation of a unique node id, so that the help index can be rebuilt properly at compile time.  My understanding was that at one time it was going to be possible to just write a new wiki entry in the online wiki help, which would get converted back into the source code help via some script magic, but I don't know what became of that.

Just a few words, and see below about combining with other info into a section on data analysis.   That's good. You might say a little bit more than you've got in the draft. Maybe you can get some ideas or words from the first paragraph of Calc Guide Chapter 8? Also, mention that in LO 3.3 this feature is called DataPilot.  After further reflection, I think perhaps a short section on data analysis, mentioning some of the methods Calc provides (with pivot tables as an important method), would be more useful in this chapter than just an item on PTs. The introductory section of Calc Guide Chapter 9 has some good ideas, and you can also mention consolidating data, subtotals, scenarios, other \"what if\" tools, goal seek, and solver. Just a few words on each.  Let's tie together the basic data entry info earlier in this Getting Started chapter and offer to readers the idea that they can go further. Hmmm, I see the CG has subtotals in Chapter 9.  BTW, references to other books are to chapters only (sometimes section headings), but never page numbers.  Section titles should start with an \"-ing\" word, for consistency with the rest of the chapter and book. So, for example, \"Using pivot tables\" (capitalization not necessary).   Together in one section, yes. Page 35 is good. A bit more discussion, please. First two paragraphs of Calc Guide Ch7, slightly modified, could be useful.    Other things to do (as listed near the top of this section, https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development#Getting_Started_Guide )  1) Use the Template Changer extension to apply the v3.4 chapter template (LO_3_4_chapter_template.ott, available from the Documentation > Resources folder in Alfresco). [You may need to download and install the extension, then download and import the template into LO. Get it from http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/template-changer and put it anywhere on your computer, then follow instructions in http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/HowTo/install_extension ] You may also wish to review the relevant part of the GS chapter on styles and templates for how to use this extension.  2) Change arrows in menu paths to > (to match most other books).  3) Ensure that feedback address on Copyright page shows documentation@global.libreoffice.org (global is missing in some chapters).  4) Check screenshots for changes. Some are definitely out of date, but I don't know which ones. Use silver/gray theme for any replacements needed. In many cases (Chapter 4,5,6,7) the component guide will contain a newer image that can be used in this book without necessity of recapturing/redoing.  --Jean  "

It divides people into four groups: those who don't understand a situation at all; those who like the idea until something happens that they don't like; those who begin work on something but let other things get in their way to prevent completion; and those who actually accomplish something some more than others and some less. Such is the case with volunteers.     People want someone to lead (read that do things for them) but seldom step up to doing things themselves as much as they should. Here is another religious reference. When Israel first neared their destination, they refused to go any further because of what 10 men had said. Talking about not following someone, the entire army (603550 men) with the exception of 2 men prepared to return to Egypt.     I'm still amazed that a wiki page has been created in which we were suppose to discuss job descriptions for the team and only two have entered anything there. I posted my thoughts, and another person added my name at the beginning of my post. That has been it. Again, I have seen several +1 with no -1 in posts. But where are their thoughts on this wiki page? Who has said that they will take responsibility for a specific area of documentation?      We are a group of individuals with talents. What is it that each one can do well? What are our areas of expertise? Who can we rely upon for help when we need it? One wiki page has a list of names, but nothing about these people as far what they can provide the the team. What is our commitment to the team?      The main goal for what the team should be accomplishing has already been stated. But how well has the main goal been broken down into smaller goals that apply to the documents for each of the components of LO?      Another wiki page diagrams the path a new document should take before it is published. So, who is going to take on the responsibility of revise a chapter or creating a new one? Who is going to review the chapters for clarity or correctness? Who is going to proofread them for grammar etc.? Who will make the final decision as to whether it should be published or not?      I have a few more thoughts as well that I will post at a later time concerning what we should tell someone who wants do some technical writing. So of it are some things that I think I remember Jean writing a few years ago (around the time of or perhaps before the appearance of OOo 2.0).   "

If something relevant crops up on another list it would be nice to have the relevant mail forwarded to here so that we could respond. Likewise if something here is relevant to one of the other lists you are subscribed to it would be nice to know that the mail gets forwarded to them.   I cover the Users, Marketing, Steering (has just changed name) and Accessibility. Users is very high traffic but Accessibility is very low. Still it is difficult to cover so many lists. Two or 3 lists each might be good for the ones i don't cover. Lets say 2 lists each, ie Docs&amp;Web or Docs&amp;Design.   The Vietnamese chap that was here last week made some interesting points and i think it would be good if there were liaison officers covering the various translation teams.  Still i think it is impractical to cover more than 2 or perhaps 3 lists. I never get time to really do anything useful or hands-on and i am going to have to drop a couple of the lists i do follow in about a month.   Having some overlap is good.

That was likely near the date that LO version 3.4.0 would not do edit changes correctly.

Changing the system just because soem people haven't yet understood the system seems a dumb idea. It's kinda 2 steps backwards and then the backwards systems will need to grow and deal with the issues that the current system already deals with At the same time the backwards system will have to worry about being backwards compatible as it tries to stumble forwards. Eventually the backwards system would doubtless arrive where we already are but the journey would be painful. Much better to simply document the current system and use it.   Just my 2cents.

David    ________________________________  From: Jean Weber  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org  Sent: Tuesday, November 8, 2011 11:04 PM Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] My work on the Getting Started Guide;  I have questions   Comments interleaved below. See also end of note for other things that need to be done.   I think the logical place would be just before \"Deleting Sheets\" on page 17; that is, after the section titled \"Inserting new sheets\". And yes, you'll need to write some text to go with it (unless the Calc Guide includes something you can reuse).   OK.   Just a few words, and see below about combining with other info into a section on data analysis.   That's good. You might say a little bit more than you've got in the draft. Maybe you can get some ideas or words from the first paragraph of Calc Guide Chapter 8? Also, mention that in LO 3.3 this feature is called DataPilot.  After further reflection, I think perhaps a short section on data analysis, mentioning some of the methods Calc provides (with pivot tables as an important method), would be more useful in this chapter than just an item on PTs. The introductory section of Calc Guide Chapter 9 has some good ideas, and you can also mention consolidating data, subtotals, scenarios, other \"what if\" tools, goal seek, and solver. Just a few words on each.  Let's tie together the basic data entry info earlier in this Getting Started chapter and offer to readers the idea that they can go further. Hmmm, I see the CG has subtotals in Chapter 9.  BTW, references to other books are to chapters only (sometimes section headings), but never page numbers.  Section titles should start with an \"-ing\" word, for consistency with the rest of the chapter and book. So, for example, \"Using pivot tables\" (capitalization not necessary).   Together in one section, yes. Page 35 is good. A bit more discussion, please. First two paragraphs of Calc Guide Ch7, slightly modified, could be useful.    Other things to do (as listed near the top of this section, https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development#Getting_Started_Guide )  1) Use the Template Changer extension to apply the v3.4 chapter template (LO_3_4_chapter_template.ott, available from the Documentation > Resources folder in Alfresco). [You may need to download and install the extension, then download and import the template into LO. Get it from http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/template-changer and put it anywhere on your computer, then follow instructions in http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/HowTo/install_extension ] You may also wish to review the relevant part of the GS chapter on styles and templates for how to use this extension.  2) Change arrows in menu paths to > (to match most other books).  3) Ensure that feedback address on Copyright page shows documentation@global.libreoffice.org (global is missing in some chapters).  4) Check screenshots for changes. Some are definitely out of date, but I don't know which ones. Use silver/gray theme for any replacements needed. In many cases (Chapter 4,5,6,7) the component guide will contain a newer image that can be used in this book without necessity of recapturing/redoing.  --Jean  "

        "text": "     I have been known to be verbose at times, but here are my thought about Step 1 of the Workflow list:  1.) The workflow begins with creating a new document or revising and      existing document.     a.) Create a new document using the latest chapter template          (currently LO_3_4_chapter_template.ott). Also study and apply          the principles of Producing-LO-userguides.odt. Both of these          documents will guide you as you write your new document.         i.) Naming convention for new documents: CCDDDBB-Name where CC              is the book initials, DD is the LibreOffice version (33 is              version 3.3 and 34 is version 3.4), and BB is the chapter              number (two digits). For directions on formating the name               of the document, see page 20 of Producing-LO-              userguides.odt. For example, WG33-WorkingWithText.odt is              chapter 3 of the Writer Guide for LibreOffice version 3.3.x.                Book initials (CC):                    GS = Getting Started                     WG = Writer Guide                     CG = Calc Guide                     DG = Draw Guide                     IG = Impress Guide                     BG = Base Guide                     MG = Math Guide     b.) Existing documents already have a template. When editing one,           you might need to update the template (first thing to check).          Then make sure you have \"change tracking\" on (Edit > Changes >          Record). Then review the document making changes as you go.     c.) Uploading drafts to the appropriate draft folder:          i.)   If you have not already done so, request your user name                and password for the Alfresco web site from the document                team mailing list. (documentation@global.libreoffice.org)          ii.)  Then sign into the Alfresco web site. The path to the                draft folder to which you should upload your draft:                Repository (at the top) > English (left side) >                Documentation > (appropriate folder for your document) >                Drafts.         iii.) Click the Upload button (at the top) and a pop-up window                appears. Click the icon containing a sheet of paper and a                magnifying glass to browse to your draft file on you                computer. Click the Upload file(s) button to begin the                uploading. (uploading process is shown over the name of                your file.) When the uploading is completed, the \"Upload                file(s)\" button changes to OK. Click it. If the uploading                fails, try again. (Some times it takes two or three tries                to successfully upload a file.) The file now appears in                the draft folder.         iv.)  Submitting your document for review: On the right side of                the file look for +More Click it to open a drop down                list. Select \"Submit for review\". (The file is moved to                the Proofing folder.)         v.)   Report what you have done to the document team mailing                 list. (documentation@global.libreoffice.org)      Perhaps this is too exact, and perhaps someone else can find a way to say these things if fewer words.  --Dan   "

        "text": "I've now looked at the file and will respond to the questions I skipped in my last note.  David Michel dsmichel@yahoo.com wrote,> p18  Some comments: 1) We do not use the term \"radio button\". Often the term \"option\" is a good choice, but in this case I would use \"action\" because the heading above the two radio buttons is \"Action\".  2) With rare exceptions, we do not use the phrase \"allows you to\". In this case a better wording would be \"Select the Move action to...\" In other situations the phrase \"Use the xxxx option to...\" might work best. The general principle is: use imperative voice (for example, \"Choose xxxx to do x\") or an infinitive phrase such as \"To do x, choose xxxx.\"  3) Although the two sentences you flagged are a bit redundant, in introductory material like this we've found that it's often best to make statements that might seem obvious to us.  4) I am sure there are other ways to move sheets, at least in some circumstances, not just using this dialog. For example, you can click-and-drag a sheet tab. This section should mention those other methods. (You may need to play around a bit to figure out what they are.)  5) The first paragraph on page 17 under the heading needs to be amended.  6) Formatting tips: Do not insert blank paragraphs by pressing Enter. Do not use two spaces after a full stop (period); use only one. Do not leave blank spaces at the end of a paragraph. If you turn on end-of-paragraph markers, you'll be able to see blank paras and spaces at the ends of paras easily.  7) Do not put quotation marks around the names of options, buttons, list boxes, or any other part of a dialog. Instead, use the OOoMenuPath character style or (in some cases) the OOoEmphasis character style, or (in some cases, such as the name of the dialog) no special style. The style descriptions in the template instructions should give a good idea of what style to use when. Unfortunately, many of the chapters do not use the agreed-upon styles, so following the examples of use in a chapter may lead you astray.   I think that's good. However, \"Analyzing data\" is a better title than \"Using data analysis\". BTW, you have used \"TextBody\" instead of \"OOoTextBody\" as the para style in that section.   You could use either bullet points or a definition list (choosing the appropriate para styles). In this case, I think a definition list would be good.   OK.   You changed the visible address, but you failed to change the hyperlink. (A common mistake.)   The only difference I can see is an icon in Fig1 and an icon in Fig 5, though I could be missing something. I may have the original .ODG files from which these PNG images were created, or a bit of fiddling in GIMP will fix the icons quickly. (I do this a lot, to avoid recapturing and relabeling.)  Whether items are gray or white usually depends on the operating system and the desktop theme in use. The blue is NOT related to the version of LibreOffice, but to your o/s.  BTW, the Figure 15 that you added appears to have been taken on Windows XP. Please change the Windows desktop from the Blue theme to the Silver theme, so any images you take will more closely match others in the book. It's in Settings > Control Panel > Display > Appearance tab; near the bottom is \"Color scheme\": choose Silver.  Although the above list of corrections may seem formidable, what you have done is fairly typical for new contributors who haven't got used to our writing and formatting style yet. I'll hand it back to you now for another try.  --Jean    "

A draft would be a new document or a revision of a published document. Once the draft has gone through the approval steps, it is published with the corresponding naming convention for published chapters.      If the draft is a revision, then it would replace the earlier published chapter. If the draft is a new chapter, it becomes a new published chapter.      Maybe what threw me was the Heading on page 20: \"Naming convention for published chapters.\" Later, the heading: \"Naming convention for published books.\" My mathematical mind asked: Then what is the convention for draft chapters?

The good news is that the ePub is not nearly as bad as I expected from my own trial conversions of OOo books over a year ago; the text is readable and the figures are in place and sized reasonably.  There is a lot of bad news, however. First, the layout has suffered. For example, the Tip/Note/Caution tables look both wrong and silly (a box with the Tip/Note/Caution words as a sort of heading, then a big gap, and then the text). Another example: The bullets and numbers on lists are offset into what would be the left-hand margin, but there really isn't a margin on the left, so they fall off the edge of the \"page\". At some magnifications, two \"columns\" or \"pages\" appear side-by-side, so numbers and bullets on lists in the right-hand column are visible. There are other conspicuous problems as well. Most or all can probably be solved by making some changes in our styles and template, if we decide that's worth doing at some point in the future "

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the ASF and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed CLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to an ASF project.   There are more than subtle differences between the AL2 and CC-BY-SA. Whilst I may not be fully satisfied with the CC-BY-SA license, it appeals to me far more than AL2.

It can not then become a \"new\" document simply because it has gone from public draft to \"public final\". Your understanding or interpretation of the word \"published\" as I appear to understand it seems to equate more to \"documentation team approved release\".  For example, the public can already access and download Base related documentation here :  http://media.libreoffice.org/cmis/browser/English/Documentation/Base%20Guide/Draft  The licenses of these documents, unless stated otherwise therein, are CC-BY-SA, in order to be in agreement with the terms of use of the TDF infrastructure.  Note that I'm not against the approach, merely pointing out what I see as a flaw in the reasoning based on the underlying tenets of copyright law.  If the documentation project really wanted to keep this as \"unpublished\" (i.e. not made available to the public), then it would have to hide access to the drafts and proofed stages of the site under the media.libreoffice.org address, and have some kind of binding agreement for the contributors of the documentation agreement that would oblige them to recognise a work as being made available only when it attained the status \"published\". As you will probably appreciate, this would probably attract a fair deal of criticism, possibly be fairly complex to set in motion, and would probably deter many from participating (who would want to sign up to something like that, especially for something they do mainly in their spare time?)

If a contributor wishes to have his/her contribution accepted within the LibreOffice project then they have to do so under the LGLP3+/MPL+ for code, or CC-BY-SA for anything else, unless there are other specific reasons for this not being the case (which will always raise the question as to whether it is really accepted or not), as for example, with some older code that has been revamped but must be kept currently under LGPL2.  So TDF (or even the German foundation currently running things while it is being set up) is not the owner of the documentation produced.  The Documentation Project is not a legal entity in the sense of the word \"organisation\" referred to in the AL2 license - it has no legal remit of representation for copyright assignments.    Indeed, I'm not (to my knowledge) employed by any entity involved in this project (thankfully), which allows me to be have an unfettered opinion. I have been known as an \"lectron libre\" in the past, and for the most part, have managed to stay that way ;-)  I have already stated on the Apache OOo list that I would not allow for the licences of any of my previous documentation contributions to be changed (since at one stage, some people were touting an \"automatic, by default change\" - fortunately, the Apache mentors of the project are crucially aware of doing this correctly when it comes to the legal issues). What the final result will be remains to be seen - I fear a severely trimmed OOo, but I am also assuming that the AOOo project will in due course fill those gaps.  Of course, my position with regard to AL2 is my own, and each person in this documentation project must decide in their own hearts/minds, how they wish to act. I am not here to sway them in one way or another on that decision. I merely wanted to point out the oversimplification that Jean made with regard to the word \"published\". This oversimplification could lead people to make a decision with regard to the licensing of their works, without understanding all of the ramifications behind it.

Much of the content on the OpenOffice.org web properties are under default terms of use that provide broad reuse, including relicensing.

The ASF is very attuned to treating such material both respectfully and appropriately with respect to conditions of the licenses that have been offered.    Furthermore, *even* if the license is compatible for inclusion in an ALv2-licensed project, it is a policy of the ASF to never include in its projects material that the license-granter does not want a project to have, even if the license allows it otherwise. That's the policy for third-party works of any origin.  Such cases have arisen.   - Dennis  -----Original Message---"

There  are exclusive rights that obtain to copyright holders.  A copyright holder can  license some or all of those rights without surrendering the copyright itself.  Absent such a license, exercise of an exclusive right by anyone but the  copyright owner constitutes infringement.  Some infringements are defensible  as \"fair use\" in some jurisdictions, but only judges decide whether the  defense succeeds.  In the example given by Tom below, (re-)distribution of the documents by TDF  is done under the CC-BY-SA and it is not a relicensing.  It is done under the  original license.  And communication of the same license to the recipients is  done under the original license.  Were the TDF or its contributors to make a  derivative work, the CC-BY-SA requires that derivative to satisfy the  Share-Alike requirement.  (It is a form of copyleft.)  Any added copyright  would apply to the new material and its combination with the original.  But  the original copyright is intact: You can't copyright the parts of a work that  are not your own independent creation (unless you've been transferred that  copyright).  Finally, note that the copyright holder still holds all of the original  exclusive rights and is not restricted by the license granted others.  That is  how Sun, which held the copyrights to OpenOffice.org, was able to  privately-license the code base under different terms than the LGPL that was  granted to the general public and used on the open-source OpenOffice.org  distributions.  One feature of reciprocal licenses that I favor is the fact  that the recipients have all of the same rights that the copyright owner has,  apart from the ability to transfer the copyright itself.   - Dennis  -----Original Message---"

For example, the author of a NEW document (not part of a user guide) about LibreOffice could choose to delete the Apache license.   In fact, AFAIK there is no requirement for such docs to be based on the user guide template  The template's main value is in providing a consistent look-and-feel (styles, colours, layout) and its use is therefore encouraged for all LO docs long enough to need pages for title, copyright, ToC. The template also provides a convenient boilerplate of text for the copyright page. But that page can be modified to fit the requirements of docs that are not part of the user guide set.  Of course that brings up the question of what is a user guide versus some other document. Are stand-alone docs also \"user guides\"? In one sense, yes, anything written to support or guide users could be considered a user guide; but I don't use that term to describe standalone docs written by individuals and contributed to the project.

If someone who did not hold the copyright made a derivative work of those documents to rebrand them for Apache OpenOffice, change screen shots, etc., they would need to honor the original license.  (If it is dual licensed the creator of the derivative has a choice which license(s) to produce the derivative under.)  If someone who held the copyright on the New documents were to make the derivative, they could certainly offer a different (dual) license.  By either route, even if one of the available licenses were an Apache ALv2 license, it still would not constitute a contribution to the Apache OpenOffice project.  Contribution is a separate act.  Now, to have it also be contributed to an Apache project, there would have to be a contribution agreement (iCLA).  Whether that is done or not is a separate decision. An Apache project, or any other project for which the ALv2 license is compatible could also rely on the new document as a 3rd party work.  In the case of an Apache project, this would not happen if the licensor objected.     A final example: If I wrote a new document that applied to LO and licensed it in a way that TDF accepts, I could also rebrand and modify it myself and offer a different license on that version.  I am in a position to go farther and contribute the rebranded one to the Apache OpenOffice project too.  That involves more steps, even though I have already registered an iCLA with ASF.

A work could be contributed under an SGA (Software Grant Agreement, I think.)  The SGA provides a permissive license to Apache that allows the work to be licensed as an Apache project result.  It has to be done by someone entitled to do so. (That is what Oracle did in licensing OpenOffice.org to the ASF.  Oracle still holds the copyright though and other licenses of the same content are not revocable.  That's why the Oracle grant does not interfere with TDF continuing with LO as a derivative of the LGPLd OO.o software.

As i understand it the objection was something to do with individuals having to sign an agreement with Apache but Dennis said that would not be required.  I am a little hazy about that tho!    I think that if employees of a 3rd party company have been ordered to work on LibreOffice then it's likely that the company has accepted that works produced by them are not the property of the 3rd party company.  The company's i can think of that are likely to let (or order) employees to work on LO are ones such as Novel, RedHat, Canonical, Google or perhaps governments such as the Spanish ones all of whom are quite familiar with and welcoming of the idea of employees doing work for other companies because it gives them a better end-product when combined with their own stuff.  I'm never sure about what is going on in Brasil but again it seems to be positive about this sort of thing.  Companies that are really strict about claiming their employees work as their own are unlikely to be contributing workers time to this project in the first place.  I gather there are some companies that impose restrictions on what employees do with their free-time especially if using company equipment.  I think employees of such companies are likely to already be aware of the likelihood of those sorts of restrictions.    So, i think all objections to dual-licensing have been eliminated but i'm still not completely certain of that.  The pedantry and legalese in this thread is difficult to understand but from what i can gather i think dual-licensing of new documentation is possible without any individuals signing CLA agreements?

Although I am a member of TDF Board of Directors and a TDF spokesperson, at the moment I am speaking as an independent individual working for the project in the marketing environment.  First, I will express my ideas.  In addition to being a professional marketer, I am a journalist and a book author. I have studied the legal aspects of documents - and related licenses - before deciding to use CC BY-NC-SA for all my licensed documents (mostly presentations).  I think it should be clear that GPL, LGPL, AL and MPL are software licenses, which have been stretched in their scope to include documents because someone - definitely not a lawyer - has thought they were appropriate. I am not familiar with the law of every country, but these licenses are not compatible - at all - with the Italian law (Codice Civile).  On the contrary, Creative Commons has been developed by Lawrence Lessig in order to protect copyright in Internet times, because Codice Civile and similar laws were not contemplating the free distribution and the reuse of contents. CC is a specific license for documents, and as such should be the only one used for documents. Using a software license does not simply make sense, and should be avoided. CC has been studied to be compatible with Codice Civile and similar laws.  In addition, The Document Foundation is definitely supporting copyleft software licenses, and actively discouraging the use of so called \"permissive\" licenses - which I personally prefer to define as \"predatory\", because they steal from the community to give to the rich and wealthy (to make it easy, the opposite of Robin Hood) - such as the Apache License.  Although we have not discussed the subject at BoD level, I can anticipate that the foreseeable result of a discussion would be against using Apache License for documents. I would personally discard a document licensed under AL, as I discard every document licensed with a software license (because they are the result of a nonsensical choice).  Of course, each individual is free to choose how to license his work, but I would really prefer to default to CC and add AL - or any other software license - only if the individual has a strong motivation to do so. Defaulting to CC/AL, in my opinion, means to \"legally\" steal the work of all people who are not enough knowledgeable about software licenses (in my opinion, the majority of people involved in documentation).  Second, I will ask questions.  Are we speaking about LibreOffice user guides? In this case, I do think that it does not even make sense to use Apache License, because LibreOffice is moving forward from that code base while AOOoI is moving backwards from the same code base thanks to the insanity of IP sanitization, and the two programs will differ in a substancial way.  Are we thinking to change the template without explaining to individuals the consequences - for their intellectual property - of the license change/addition? I would personally find this EXTREMELY unfair, and I would personally veto the license change without a clear and visible explanation of the consequences for their work of AL adoption for documents.  ---"

You will find that many questions are very basic and are easily answered by the regulars on the list or forum. But some questions are not so easily answered.

Sometimes the \"real\" question is clear if you are familiar with what the user is trying to do or if you recognise they are using Microsoft terminology and LibreOffice's terms are different; the user may in fact be asking the wrong question to get the answer they need.

        "text": "Thank you Jean. I have already subscribed to both the forum and user list as you suggested.  Yet, in my experience training customer service reps, I'd like to add some more advice that may come in useful before answering user's questions. Answering difficult questions is indeed a great practice. However, considering that users may ask the wrong questions (or the right questions in the wrong words), we have to make sure we master the key concepts before attempting to answer them. Otherwise, we may get confused ourselves and end up messing up our ideas or even the docs we are working on.  What I suggest is to follow a systematic approach:  1). Decide which your area of expertise will be. LibreOffice is a broad project, and mastering it all may be too much to do it all at once. For example, I never use LO Math because I don't need it but mainly because my knowledge of mathematics is too limited. Instead, I use Calc on a daily basis, so I decided to master that application first.  2). Make acquainted with the application of your choice. Read the existing user guides. Make yourself familiar with the terminoly and concepts.  Try the application yourself. This will help you understand it better. Before being ready to answer other people questions, we must be able to answer our own questions. Don't be afraid of asking. Remember that every good teacher has started as a good student.  3). Help other users. Once we feel confident enough to use the application ourselves, we can start helping others. I usually use the following strategy when dealing with customers:  - Read the question between the lines. What is important is not what the user is asking, but what the user is really trying to do. Remember that they are not specialists and sometimes don't know how to ask for help and end up putting forth general question such as \"I cannot use a formula in Calc\". Therefore, before attempting to solve a problem, we must guide the user to provide the right info. How can we do it? Simple, ask them more questions. Help the user narrow the question until we know exactly what the problem is.  - Once we pinpoint the problem we can start looking for the answer. If we are familiar with the application, we may possibly know the answer. If not, we will know where to look.  - When we have the answer, put it forth in a clear and consice way.  Hope you find it useful. Regards  Gabriel   "

I think it's a LOT easier to avoid the issue now than to deal with paying legal experts time, adding extra days in courts, perhaps paying damages afterwards. It's not likely to be the main thrust of an MS suit against us but it might be an extra card they play in court timed to gain tactical advantage by distracting our defence from the main fight.   MS Office is a major percentage of MS profits. To think that MS wont come after us at some point seems very naive unless LO remains a tiny percentage of the market. Under TDF LO has grown significantly faster than during any equivalent time-frame under Sun.   I don't see the point in risking it when we really don't need to. There are a tiny percentage of pix that are significantly different in Windows so it makes sense to minimise our risks to that tiny percentage. Also, why promote MS in the guides?

In fact, all of the replacement pix that show icons are using the wrong set. 3) All blank paragraphs should be removed. Most of them appear to be after new figures. Paragraphs with figures must be in OOoFigure style, not OOoTextBody style. 4) Unsaved changes icon (status bar) has changed. 5) Please replace the little arrows in menu paths with >, making sure that the character style for the > and the space before and after it is OOoMenuPath. 6) One trick I use for getting rid of the OOo logo in the upper left of pix that are otherwise okay is to open the pic in Gimp and fiddle it there--instead of recapturing all the pix. Since many of the pix in the earlier chapter are of a higher quality, that might improve the result. Of course, some pix are wrong in other ways, so that trick might not work. 7) Please set LO to use its own Save and Open dialogs. I think you've used a Ubuntu Save dialog in Figure 16. 8) Be sure that no paragraphs are of style \"Default\". 9) In procedural lists, sentences should end with a period (full stop), unless a colon is needed to introduce a nest list. 10) Sheets can be moved in another way (by dragging) in addition to the new way that you have correctly described.

I'm now fairly sure that others have reported the problem, but I didn't realise what they were talking about.  In penance, I have worked out how to solve this problem and get us all able to use the same icon set. It appears to be a simple solution: download LO from the LO website and install and use that when writing documentation.  This is what I did. I have two machines with \"clean\" Ubuntu 11.10 installs on them, which includes LO 3.4.3. Those copies of LO show only the Human icon sets, just as in Gabriel's picture.  I then downloaded and installed LO 3.4.4 from the LO website. When I open that, all the various icon sets are listed in Tools > Options > LO > View, as I described in a previous note.  Repeating: When writing documentation, be sure you install LO from the file available on the LO website. The instructions I've written elsewhere mention this, for other reasons; I hadn't realised (or had forgotten) that the icon sets are yet another reason to NOT use the file provided by a Linux distro when writing docs. It's fine for general use, but it does have a few differences that make it unsuitable for general documentation purposes.  Of course, this means that some Linux users will see different icons; but if we use Ubuntu's icon set, then everyone else is going to see different icons. So we'll do the only reasonable thing, which is to document the official LO version, not Ubuntu's version of LO.  This also reminds me that I need to add some words in each chapter file to advise people that the icons they see may not be what's in the book. I shall do so, and put it in the template.  --Jean  "

The new file is:  0105GS34-THIRDDraftGettingStartedWithCalcDavidMichel  Here is an update of what I have done, and I hope I did not overlook something:  I forgot to mention a comment I made on page 8. What do you think?   p.18:  I replaced \"radio button\" with \"action\".   p.18:  I removed the phrase \"allows you to\". I found no other examples of this phrase.   The only method I found was drag and drop, and I wrote something brief.   Do you mean the paragraph under \"Inserting new sheets\"? What do you want me to change?   The OOoTextBody style removed the spaces between the paragraphs. I checked for a single space after the periods on both pages 18 and 36-37.  p.36 I used OOoTextBody for the text, and the Definition styles for the definitions, using the definitions on page 36 as a guide.   I changed the email address.   Figure 15 is now silver.   I copied an arrow, and did a find and replace with a \">\" - but, all it did was give me an arrow and a \">\", and I could not delete the arrow. Also, is there a way of adding a style to this character at once for all of its 96 instances?    I typed in the URL, not from a link. The same error message appears.   I could not continue after step 3. The attached image shows that I did not have the files the instructions show.    ________________________________  From: Jean Weber  To: Documentation@global.libreoffice.org  Sent: Saturday, November 19, 2011 7:33 PM Subject: [libreoffice-documentation] Re: My work on the Getting Started Guide   I've now looked at the file and will respond to the questions I skipped in my last note.  David Michel dsmichel@yahoo.com wrote,> p18  Some comments: 1) We do not use the term \"radio button\". Often the term \"option\" is a good choice, but in this case I would use \"action\" because the heading above the two radio buttons is \"Action\".  2) With rare exceptions, we do not use the phrase \"allows you to\". In this case a better wording would be \"Select the Move action to...\" In other situations the phrase \"Use the xxxx option to...\" might work best. The general principle is: use imperative voice (for example, \"Choose xxxx to do x\") or an infinitive phrase such as \"To do x, choose xxxx.\"  3) Although the two sentences you flagged are a bit redundant, in introductory material like this we've found that it's often best to make statements that might seem obvious to us.  4) I am sure there are other ways to move sheets, at least in some circumstances, not just using this dialog. For example, you can click-and-drag a sheet tab. This section should mention those other methods. (You may need to play around a bit to figure out what they are.)  5) The first paragraph on page 17 under the heading needs to be amended.  6) Formatting tips: Do not insert blank paragraphs by pressing Enter. Do not use two spaces after a full stop (period); use only one. Do not leave blank spaces at the end of a paragraph. If you turn on end-of-paragraph markers, you'll be able to see blank paras and spaces at the ends of paras easily.  7) Do not put quotation marks around the names of options, buttons, list boxes, or any other part of a dialog. Instead, use the OOoMenuPath character style or (in some cases) the OOoEmphasis character style, or (in some cases, such as the name of the dialog) no special style. The style descriptions in the template instructions should give a good idea of what style to use when. Unfortunately, many of the chapters do not use the agreed-upon styles, so following the examples of use in a chapter may lead you astray.   I think that's good. However, \"Analyzing data\" is a better title than \"Using data analysis\". BTW, you have used \"TextBody\" instead of \"OOoTextBody\" as the para style in that section.   You could use either bullet points or a definition list (choosing the appropriate para styles). In this case, I think a definition list would be good.   OK.   You changed the visible address, but you failed to change the hyperlink. (A common mistake.)   The only difference I can see is an icon in Fig1 and an icon in Fig 5, though I could be missing something. I may have the original .ODG files from which these PNG images were created, or a bit of fiddling in GIMP will fix the icons quickly. (I do this a lot, to avoid recapturing and relabeling.)  Whether items are gray or white usually depends on the operating system and the desktop theme in use. The blue is NOT related to the version of LibreOffice, but to your o/s.  BTW, the Figure 15 that you added appears to have been taken on Windows XP. Please change the Windows desktop from the Blue theme to the Silver theme, so any images you take will more closely match others in the book. It's in Settings > Control Panel > Display > Appearance tab; near the bottom is \"Color scheme\": choose Silver.  Although the above list of corrections may seem formidable, what you have done is fairly typical for new contributors who haven't got used to our writing and formatting style yet. I'll hand it back to you now for another try.  --Jean    "

I also produced a clean copy incorporating all the changes and placed it into Proofing so Gabriel or Hazel (or anyone) can have a crack at it.  BTW, when I was playing around with moving and copying sheets, I discovered two things that are not new but were never written up in any earlier version of the Calc Guide, as far as I can tell: (1) As well as moving a sheet within a spreadsheet using drag-and drop, you can also copy a sheet by holding down the Control key while dragging. I added some info about this. (2) The Move/Copy dialog isn't new; it's just been redesigned, and that brought it to my attention on the features list.  Gabriel, when you've done some more chapters of the Calc Guide, you may have some new screenshots to replace the Windows ones. If so, and if those screenshots are also used in this Getting Started chapter, you or David should revisit this chapter and replace the screenshots here.    Good idea. I copied the picture that Gariel had produced for the Calc Guide.   I found at least one instance of \"allows the user to\" and edited it out.   No, I meant the paragraph under the main heading \"Working with sheets\", which now includes copying and moving.   The Definition lists use two styles: \"OOoDefinition Term\" for the bolded first line (a paragraph on its own) of each item, and \"OOoDefinition\" for the following paragraph.   Most of the arrows were replaced as one would expect, though a few were not (I've now fixed them). I don't know why you couldn't delete the arrow in a few instances.   AFAIK, you cannot apply a character style using Find and Replace. One can record a macro to do the job, but otherwise it's a manual operation.   I guess my question wasn't clear.

All can be done with just the one series.See attached screen capture, all the user needs to do is hold done the CTRL key and he/she can select, for example, sum, min, max and the Pivot Table wil show all three.

(Use the dialog to change the name of the autotext entries.      I am also writing a short chapter on how to use the AutoText dialog in our documents for the Contributor's Guide.

What I need is some more some more suggestions at to what should be put into the LO.bau file. Any suggestions as to things you would like to insert into your document with only a few key strokes?      On page 11 of the template, Figure 1 contains a picture at the top with several arrows and a table below the picture. I have created a table within a form for this. Place the graphic in the top row (all the cells of this row are merged for this purpose). The columns in the other rows are formated to hold the numbers and category descriptions and be the proper dimensions. I further refined this by making two autotext entries from this. One has six columns in the table just like Figure 1. The other one has only four columns for graphics with fewer categories.      The last autotext entry in the LO.bau file for now is a simple frame. This entry would have the proper formats applied so that the frame would appear in the proper place. The only adjustment would be with the frame's width.      The first version of the LO.bau file is being uploaded to Alfresco: http://alfresco.libreoffice.org/share/page/repository#filter=path|% 2FEnglish%2FDocumentation%2FResources%2FDraft&amp;page=1.

Now, theoretically, there should have been no data loss. \"If any of the repo is there, it should all be there\", so to speak.

For the moment, if someone feels like it, they could re-upload any missing content into a folder called \"Drafts Restored\" in each of the said book folders, structured as before...  I'm *suspecting* that the affected folders may have been uploaded into while the upgrade was being done... I've noticed that stuff uploaded/updated before and after Dec 29/Dec 30 *seems* to be intact. Am I correct about that?  During the last minor upgrade (3.2 to 3.4), there was no problem. It is true that this is a more-major upgrade (3.4 to 4.0), but I'm not currently aware of any radical changes in Alfresco that would make an Alfresco upgrade hazardous.  Any further information from anyone? Otherwise, there will be more news on Monday...  Happy New Year to those of you that celebrate it.  "

AFAIK, nothing new or changed was done to several of those folders, but I won't be able to check them until tomorrow.

Apparently I missed the note in which we were advised in advance of the timing of this upgrade, so we could avoid up- or downloading files during the work.   --Jean "

So I think that any work done on the repo from now on will be alright.  In any case, Monday I'll be checking things out more thoroughly. There is a backup of the repo that was taken before the upgrade, and there is a previous backup taken Dec 25.   Mea culpa. I've been frantically busy workwise recently, and found an unplanned timeslot for the upgrade at a time when I figured that Europe/Asia-Pacific would be largely asleep or early in the morning, and went ahead. I was keen to bring the new 4.0.c improvements to the LibO repo because the file uploading is much more robust (I've been extensively testing it in my own work).  After investigating the problem, I'll be working on restoring any lost content.  Please feel free to send me all your files that can be uploaded: if I can rebuild the problematic folders then I think it's maybe better to do that than to simply rollback to an earlier backup. What do you guys think about that?  "

There were *many* older (i.e., not new or recently changed) files in most of the Drafts folders, almost all of which are now empty. I'm not sure, but I think some of the empty Proofing folders may have had items in them as well.  IMO rolling back to a recent backup will be a lot less hassle and a lot less likely to result in uploading the wrong files from what we have on our home machines "
