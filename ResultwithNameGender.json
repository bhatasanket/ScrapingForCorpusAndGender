As you probably know, the user guides from the OOo Documentation Project are produced by the OOoAuthors group, which is a community group with its own website. We have been talking about making some changes in the ODT files to make it easier for people to reuse those files for LibO (things like using a variable for the name of the program) but we have not done that yet.  Meanwhile, I have already produced a draft template for LibO user guides and a set of draft files for the Getting Started with LibO guide. A few pictures need to be replaced, and the chapters all need to be reviewed, but most of the work has been done "

Would it be possible to have just links to each language main page, just as, for  example, www.wikipedia.org ? And, finally, keep all pages of each language under each language code?

I am working with two teammates on the project towards the goal of creating a 15-20 page document by November 17.

Of course, to proceed with this project, we would need your consent and what you think are the requirements for this project.

I put together a draft template for the user guides, but it isn't \"official\" (yet), there is no requirement to use it for the sort of short document you have described, and it might not be the best choice for your doc anyway.  http://www.oooauthors.org/english/libreoffice3/resources/LO3_chapter_template.ott/view   Your document should have a license (copyright) compatible with the project; CC-BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) is probably best. It should be made available in ODT format as well as any other formats you may wish to provide (PDF?).  FYI, here is my wish list for topics to cover for techwriters: http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Dashboard/Tutorials/Targeted#Topics_to_cover_for_technical_writers   Obviously that is too long a list for your project, but the subset you have suggested sounds like a good starting point.

Also, it may very well be that everything is already in place (things have moved quite quickly recently), in which case please accept my apologies.  I have been a volunteer in OOoAuthors for some time now, but I am quite interested in giving a hand in developing the documentation for LibO. At present thanks to the OOoAuthors website and thanks to the great job that Jean is doing, we have a set of well oiled mechanisms and procedures as well as many resources on the openoffice.org web site coupled with a well established working method to help us.  Particularly with regards to the last two points, I am wondering then if we will be able to rely on the same \"service level\" when migrating to LibO.  Here's a (non exhaustive?) list of things that I think would be very useful  1. Release schedule (of course approximate) and version numbering scheme - this would allow some planning (e.g. only update the documentation for major releases) 2. List of new features and enhancements contained in the release - The OpenOffice.org release notes are quite useful as they list all the new features integrated with links to the corresponding issue (if any) and specifications (if any). 3. List of bugs that have been squashed in the release - again OpenOffice.org provides an excellent tool. The current bugzilla hosted by bugs.freedesktop.org is OK but it seems to have a reduced number of functionality (e.g. search, voting, target) 4. Changes to the online help - often the online help is a good starting point when preparing the guides.  Cheers,  Michele   "

I have placed copies of some draft chapters of a Getting Started guide and a Writer Guide for LibreOffice (in .ODT format) on the wiki, http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation  These chapters are ported from the same chapters for OOo3.3, so they may contain incorrect information or screen captures for LibreOffice.  Volunteers are needed to check and update these chapters before publication. Contributors are encouraged to work on these chapters through the OOoAuthors website, http://www.oooauthors.org/english/libreoffice3/ where you will need a login and \"author\" access. If individuals or a group wish to work in other ways, go ahead.  I intend to continue making chapters available for LibO as we update them for OOo, but otherwise I do not have time to be involved in organising or coordinating the work on LibO documentation.

My point was that installation instructions should be included with the package and/or in the download page.  Or much better, instead of telling the user what he should type in the terminal, put it into a script and call it something like \"setup\".  I usually expect any software I download to automatically install itself with a click. Which is what usually happens when you use any \"popular\" operating system (and distro in the case of gnu/linux).  I'm still a newbie with Ubuntu and I've only used it for a while, but i've installed a few programs and this was the first time I downloaded a program and had to _figure out_ how to install it.  By the way the procedure mentioned in the blog article of converting the RPMs into DEBs with alien doesn't work, it prints a lot of error messages and doesn't generate the expected debs.  If the most \"correct\" way to install libreOffice in Ubuntu is from the debs, then I don't understand why they are not linked to in the main download page, it's a bit absurd that one has to google for them.  You may argue Ubuntu is just one of many distros, but the same can be said of.... whatever distro uses RPM packages.     "

Maybe not needed for the problem you identified (these mistakes are generally corrected during the revision process) but to create new \"features\" requests or enhancements as LibO moves from version 3.3 to future releases and new functionality is made available.  Unfortunately I have no experience in this area (besides filing bugs) but it would help to have a documentation category in the bug tracker. This never happened with OOo because the OOoAuthors produced user guides are not an organic part of the project and setting up a bugzilla for the documentation only is a bit of an overkill.  I think this is one of the most attractive aspects of LibO compared to OOo (in the documentation area): the chance for the documentation besides the online help to be a rightful and integrated part of the project.

Feel free to use or change it. Note, that it may be  inaccurate or outdated.   Verbal description (AFAIR):  There are 2 main workflow pathways: A simple one for internal documents  and another one leading to externally published documents.  The internal path only has 2 states: draft &amp; published internally.  The external path includes 3 different document states:  internal draft,  pending review (which means, submitted for publication),  published externally.   Transitions are, of course, submission, publication, and retraction (the  latter leading back to draft state[?])  L10N: Documents from any state might give rise to translation  activities, which again would open the same (or a similar) workflow for  the (now localized) document.   The main 2 problems in the (folder based) Plone system IMHO was to find  a document (where is the newest version?) and to get a quick overview  over the project state (how many documents are in which state, how many  untranslated documents, etc.). Hence, keeping track over the project  had to be done mainly by a human (i.e. Jean ;-) ).  Also missing are \"minor\" state informations e.g. \"checked for software  version X.Y\" or \"indexed\" or \"branding updated\" or similar (which is a  minor point but nice2have, and could be done e.g. by tagging).

As for the website, this has been in some teams used only as download  container for ODT and PDF documents.

Much manual tweaking is then required to end up with an attractive, well laid out odt to convert to pdf.  Starting with odt and then outputting to other formats generally works well, IF the odt is created using an appropriate template and layout rules. However, some of the layout in the current OOo books does not work when output to HTML and some is a bit messy when output to wiki format. Post-processing may clean it up, but more manual intervention may be necessary. I have not found time to rework the layout and template to avoid (or at least minimise) these problems.

Depending on who made the edit, he will either just leave the edit as is (if it's from a known contributor) or validate the edit (if it's from an unknown contributor).  - With each release of OOo, he reviews the edits on the Basic and Admin guide. The Dev guide will only get a cursory review due to its size.  - There currently is no publish cycle for the Dev Guide... mainly due to its size (+/- 2000 A4 pages)  - With each _major_ release, Clayton packages up the Admin Guide and Basic Guide in ODT and PDF formats - he generally doesn't do this for point releases. The Admin Guide and Basic guide have, historically, been translated by Sun (into about 6 other languages), so part of the release process included preparation work so that the Sun translators could extract the Wiki content and translate it.   - The community contributions for the Dev Guide are different from the contributions for the User Guides. The Dev Guide is more or less a collection of concepts, not a book you want to read from cover to cover. In the Dev guide, the contributions come almost 100% from Sun/Oracle developers. External contributions are rare.  So, there's not much of a release process in place. The nature of the development documentation is that it's a continuous evolution, and not so fixed to each specific release of OOo.  --Jean    "

An updated font and colour scheme will be very important to make it appear 'new'.   This sounds fantastic. I have found in my work as a professional end user I always use outline numbering. It makes it look more professional and brings with it some big advantages for ease of use. I don't think it would make it unapproachable as Jean suggests as a lot of end user products now use numbered outlines (See Wikipedia:OpenOffice.org). I also think this more professional look would also assist the LibreOffice product in breaking into enterprise markets.  Jean:  This is a challenge. The good part is that if the chapter and numbering system does not allow us to do this we can alter the program so that it can handle this requirement, and it is a very important requirement for many professional end users.

Pages that do not define a responsible user inherits the responsible user of it parent. This can be implemented in Drupal as a field on the chapter edition page, hidden when viewing it, and the we can do reports on who are responsible of. Ok, now we know who is responsible of what chapter... now what? What we need to do with this information? Get a notification if the book is modified... what else?  This page has more info than you want, but one relevant part is the list  You're right, always exporting or changing from one complex format as ODT to Wiki/HTML has problems. We will check the performance of the ODT Import module for Drupal to know what are the capabilities of the plugin. If a correct import is done, people could work on ODT and then import them to nodes on Drupal, so people will be able to read it online on site as a book in many ways.  Cheers  "

So, I have homework :P  For Internal linking I usually use http://drupal.org/project/pathfilter  with http://drupal.org/project/linkit for a good user friendly internal links feature.

I don't think that a formal decision has been made. Up to now, there is  no official (or inofficial) team in charge of the doc project. So who  should make a decision? Things are just evolving ;-)  But anyways - I think it would be a good decision to take ODT as master  format for User Guides and Wiki as master for Developer documents.  Conversion ODT -> Wiki and vice versa is possible but time consuming,  so keeping both formats in sync does not seem a good option unless we  have enough people taking the task.  With using drupal as CMS there could be a third option: to produce  drupal master documents which then could be offered in web form and  then transformed to ODT/PDF, but this possibility has to be implemented  and tested still.

I'm a member of the Drupal team.  However, I am also a member of the marketing team. If I could perhaps just add my opinion to this.  From the perspective of the \"outside world\" the public face of the LibO documents section, it would seem to make sense that documents be provided in the first place in our native ODT formats. This should be trumpeted as our success in document achievement. I think that this is an expectation that we all share.  Also, if we are going to keep advertising the virtues of the ODF files. It would seem to make sense that we find ways to make the ODF files system \"play nice\" with the internal document flow. What better occasion would we get than having the use of a corporate-like structure such as the \"TDF/LibreOffice document team division\" use the ODF files internally at developing documents from start to end. We have our devs on-side for the development of an Office Suite championing the use of ODF, would it not make sense that we would try to make the creation/editing of internal ODF documents part of the internal process? The devs could could help in making this work. We could then, without any doubt, suggest and prove that using the ODF in creating documents in a corporate structure, from start to end production, is entirely and assuredly possible.  If so, as a group of committed document editing professionals, as you all are, you could use this occasion to streamline the ODF documents to work in such a process.  This would certainly help in marketing our LibO Suite as a viable office suite for the corporate/enterprise world.  Just my thoughts.

To me, the most productive thing people could do is join the OOoAuthors team  and contribute there, then take the product and edit and add to suit for  LibreO.

As a general rule of thumb, you can expect to run into installation problems with 800-1000 or more installed fonts. In practice, you'll probably encounter system slowdowns with fewer fonts. There is no magic number. The maximum number of fonts will vary from system to system due to the way the Windows System Registry works.  There is a Registry Key within Windows (for Win9x and WinME versions) that contains the names of all the TrueType fonts installed and the paths to those fonts. This Registry Key has a size limit. When that limit is reached, you can no longer install more fonts. If all your fonts have very short names you can install more fonts than if they all had very long names.  But \"too many\" is more than just a limitation of the operating system. Do you really want to scroll through a list of 700 or even 500 fonts from within your software applications? For best performance and ease of use, you'd do well to limit installed fonts to fewer than 500, perhaps as few as 200 if you're using a font manager as described below.  http://desktoppub.about.com/od/fonttechnologies/f/toomanyfontswin.htm  Besides the registry limitation, you have to consider memory limits as well. 600 or more may cause slow performance for a users pc. But I agree that installing a few fonts is a good idea. I have just over 200 fonts on my system and I've had OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice and Microsoft Office installed.  I'd be interested to see which fonts are installed with the current LibreOffice installation. Anyone know? I think installing 10 or so fonts with LibO would be a good number.  Ron   "

On the cover page there is a field at the end of the line \"Getting Started Guide\" which hides that line on the title page of a chapter when it is part of a book. IMO that line is redundant in a full book. Of course you may prefer to have that line on each chapter in a compiled book, in which case by all means delete that field.  Of more importance: there are two blank spaces before the name of the chapter. These are essential for correct spacing of elements in the footer when the chapter is part of a compiled book (using a master document).  BTW, Ron, I'm going to retrofit some of your edits into the OOo version of these chapters, because they are improvements on what's in the originals. Thanks!  And while I'm going through your edits to pinch the best ones, I'll probably accept most of your changes (other than the questions that others need to consider) and put the result on the website as the latest version.  --Jean     "

I'm a Brit myself but, certainly at the moment, it seems more realistic to target getting a comprehensive set of documentation in *one* variety of English. So maybe \"International\" English with US spelling is the best option at this time. Perhaps when the LibO project is at a more mature stage, there will be manpower to do localized documentation for Australia and New Zealand, Canada, the UK, the US...  As regards punctuation, when I write professionally, I like to use punctuation that conforms to formal grammatical parsing, like as wot Winston Churchill sed.  Anyway, for the proofreading that I've started, I'd be really grateful if you could maybe watch this thread, where I'll be posting a few questions:  http://www.libreoffice.org/lists/documentation/msg00172.html  A big thanks if so. :-)  David Nelson  "

However, we might get this issue - people sending out Liberation Sans or Droid Sans-filled documents, with the receivers wondering why the document doesn't look right. Then again, if you're sending out documents where formatting is key, then you would use PDF, which embeds the fonts...?  I think, if you distributed ~20 or so fonts, it would be no big deal for space or for hitting that font limit. It could only be a benefit in the end users mind, especially if you add in the Droid fonts (which imo look the best), as it's a new set of fonts to play around with.

Feel free to give it a good workout and thanks for the help in ironing out the bugs.  *****PLEASE LEAVE IMPRESSIONS/FEEDBACK ON THE WEBSITE MAILIST THREAD HERE  http://www.libreoffice.org/lists/website/msg00932.html  ******  Marc  ===================  Hi everyone,  We think the editor of the Drupal site is ready, please could this kind community give a try and give us feedback :D  The main page is here:  http://libreofficeaustralia.org/richeditortest/rich-editor-test-book  Please leave all the formats so we can continue testing on this page.  So can create as many you want childs for testing here:  http://libreofficeaustralia.org/node/add/re-test?parent=1275  Things to consider:  - Full HTML is not allowed, the tags, attributes and even inline CSS styles were configured, so, if you observe that the filter is taking out a generated style please let us know. - I've selected and grouped buttons on what I think is a good balance between website security and usability of the editor. Please, if you need some other functionality let us know. - The caption and upload image feature (se below) are javascript , so not avalaible on configurations with javascript disabled.  - The CSS of the images blocks and the little magnifying glass was a quick thing, I know it's not perfect.  Features of the editor:  - Well most of you can see. Everything should work. - You can resize the image (changing width and height), and a filter  actually resizes the image and, if resized, the image links to the original. - If you put a title to and image a caption below of the image will appear.  - If you don't want a caption to appear you can remove the title of the image or remove the \"caption\" class of that image. Double click >> Advanced >> Classes  - The link button now has the abilitty to link easilly to internal content.  Known bugs:  - Inserting an image in Firefox shows a broken image. If you preview or  disable/enable the editor the image appears. This is a bug in CKEditor: http://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/5218 (Upstream bug)  http://drupal.org/node/725154 (Drupal bug) - The option \"Cleanup styles on standard paste\" is enabled, but it's not  working for some reason. I'll check that later, until now, you will have to use the \"Remove format\" button when copying for another web to remove  the formmating or use the button \"Paste as text\". - In-editor live image resize doesn't work on Chromium, but works on  Firefox. You can resize an image on Chromium by double clicking on it and changing the values of heigth/width. Ironically, you can not resize  an image in the live resizer on Firefox because of bug 1.  Pending:  - A more user friendly link to files. Right now you can upload files and  create a link, but is not so user friendly. - I haven't defined a criteria for the search of internal linking, so everything  shows up. Try typing \"Libre\" to see it work. - Lightbox on click on a image?  Notes on implementation:  - I've tested a lot of modules for image handling in Drupal:  Image Assist http://drupal.org/project/img_assist Image browser http://drupal.org/project/imagebrowser WYSIWYG Image Upload http://drupal.org/project/wysiwyg_imageupload IMCE http://drupal.org/project/imce  And discarted all of them. At the end, I implemented a custom image upload as explained here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLB9-1t_mrE  That includes the modules: cck, imagefield, transliteration, image_resize_filter, insert, image_caption and lightbox  I've updated this page to reflect the current state:  http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Website/Drupal_Modules#User_interface  Now, some sleep.

The custom styles do not need to set up with their parameters initially--just give the styles appropriate, useful names to serve as arrows in your quiver to use when needed.  If you intend to use subdocuments in a master document, you might want to take care not to use a generic term for a paragraph style, say Title, in all the docs because an automatic generation of a ToC would treat all such styles with that term the same--usually not what you want. To get around that, you might want to include custom styles named Book title, Chapter title, Front-matter title, etc.  Anyway, it is a good habit to start with some custom styles (as needed) right from the start when designing any template.  For practice, every so often I might take an OOo template, make some changes to it, then save it as a DOC file and import that DOC file into Adobe FrameMaker and see how that goes--usually (hopefully) pretty straightforward and flawless. FrameMaker is a much better medium for bookmaking in that crossrefs between external subdocuments are much easier to effect and thus are more reliable. Besides, FrameMaker is a hybrid word processor/DTP app that has better typesetting algorithms than a fancy word processor. (Adobe InDesign is even better yet). But that is my personal preference as to building books (master docs) for PDFs or print.  Also, MS Word makes beautiful tables with ease. So converting them afterward to another medium like OOo or FrameMaker can take advantage of that Word feature. You could create a series of custom tables in Word and collect them and convert them for later use in OOo or FrameMaker--provided that you do not mind using packages developed by private companies. Some people have hangups about using a proprietary software package or O/S.    "

I slightly altered the English for what, IMHO, would be better for an international reader base, but no major rewrites. I reformulated some sentences, added bits, etc. Anyway, you'll see all that.  IMHO, it's a nice draft.  If it was for the LibreOffice documentation set, I'd suggest \"Power Users Guide\" for the title. That's the audience it fits, and it doesn't have much content that makes it really specific to technical writers.  A few ideas: maybe you could address the subject of bibliography a bit more, for example? (Even if not in too much detail.) Same thing for fields? Also, maybe you could cover MACROS (macro recording, if not macro programming), and the advanced aspects of find-and-replace? (Regular expressions is what I'm thinking of.)  Anyway, IMVHO, it's nicely written and packs a lot into a small manual, so that more-advanced users can get up to speed quickly without having to read large volumes of documentation.  I understand you have a size constraint to comply with. If you don't have time or if you can't write much more (because of your project rules), maybe I could help you develop the above suggestions.

I think people have found it a good way to exchange opinions and information quickly, and have also found it a great way to get to know each other better and develop a team spirit. Of course, there are almost certainly people who prefer just to do their contributing without having that kind of interaction with other project members.  But I'd like to suggest organizing a conference call for documentation contributors - at least as a one-time thing (we could discuss the idea of regular or periodic conferences during the call). Some reasons for doing this are as follows:  1) I'd like to talk to some of the more-long-standing contributors and get a better idea of what material and resources the project already has, and what we could usefully work on developing.  2) We could get an idea of how many active documentation contributors there actually are in the LibO community.  3) We could talk about workflows, and try and establish who would like to play what role(s).  4) We can discuss working rules and conventions, to help new contributors like me get up to speed more quickly.  5) We can talk about the above more quickly than via posts to the mailing list, and can then follow up with further development of what we discuss, on the mailing list and on the wiki. If anyone's interested, we can also work live on a Google Wave (I could provide a place to do that temporarily until the project gets its own Wave resource, and we can make the Wave public).  Any reactions about all that?  If people seem favorable, I can follow up with Florian Effenberger to arrange for access to the Talkyoo channel, we can set up a poll to see when the best date and time is (hopefully in the *very near* future), and I can create a wiki page where we can work-up an agenda.

One of the biggest problems causing the need for users especially new ones to need help is the lack of a good users manual. The OOo documentation site is very confusing, there are too many manuals to choose from and nothing says anything like \"If you are a new user, this is the one you want\". I could be wrong in this, but I don't think that I am. The only module I ever use with any regularity is Writer. If I can figure out how to use it, I might use Calc for a personal check register, likewise I might use Base for a list of all my DVD collection, but it's Writer that I use daily. I suspect that I am fairly typical in this, and that perhaps 50% or more of OOo, and now LO users use Writer far more than they use the other applications. A survey might tell us if that is so.   Assuming that it is, I think the primary users manual should focus on Writer, with just one chapter on each of the other modules, and a pointer to where to download a more extensive manual on each. Where I disagree with most who write in, is that I think that a basic manual like I describe *should be in the download package*. In order to keep it small for that reason, it should be in ODF format not PDF, and it should be formatted for an 8.5x11 page rather than the usual 5x7 so that it would be practical for the user to print out without the horrendous paper waste of the 5x7 format. (Remember all printer paper comes in 8.5x11 or similar) Also keeping it to 100 pages or less will both keep the download size down, and encourage users to actually print a hard copy. (a hard copy is very useful because you can read in the manual while using the software) I find help often less than helpful simply because it can be difficult to both read how to do a thing and simultaneously do it. I recognize that a much longer and more detailed manual is required to completely cover subjects like Styles, but for all beginners, and most other users a manual like I just described is what's needed. Probably organized with an introduction to the most used commands, then a tutorial, then a reference section.  This could be one thing that would set LO apart from other packages that offer good word processors, Even expensive MS basically sucks in the area of manuals and user support. Years ago they used to be much better in this area. Good user support seems to be the first thing that for profit companies give up when they think they can get away with it.  ========================  I was just wondering how large was the Writer documentation and in what format is it available? Of course the Writer module would be made downloadable for LibreOffice users if this were possible rather than his suggestion of including it in the package.  How logical does his suggestion sound?

At one point we were not allowed to put the ODTs on the main OOo website because of license differences, but there are links to where one can get them.   2) In most cases, the PDFs are *smaller* in filesize than the ODTs.  3) The PDFs of the OOo Writer Guide and the other user guides in their current form (for V3.2) are NOT formatted for 5X7, although at least one older version of those books was made available in the PDF used for the pre-printed guide sold through Lulu, which is close to that size. The current are formatted for reading on screen and for printing 2-up on A4/US paper.   After complaints from users who wanted to print them, the draft V3.3 guides (and the first draft of the LibO guides) have been reformatted for printing on A4/US paper size.  4) OOo provides the user guides in chapters as well as full books, because we know that often people want only a subset of the information.   5) Surely the answer to \"if you are a new user, this is the one you want\" is the book titled _Getting Started with OOo_.  Having said all that, I agree that improvements could (and should) be made. I think the current \"Getting Started with OOo\" book, at over 350 pages, is much too long. My original intention was to have it no more than 200 pages, but it grew... people kept adding things and it's hard to decide "

And after I change the style on one page, and I scroll to another page that has a different style and click in it, the highlighted style in the Styles window doesn't change to reflect the correct style for that page. Does anyone else experience this?  Ron  "

(I am assuming the files on the LibO site are the latest; is that correct?)  For example, there are a lot of Getting Started files on the Review List at OOoAuthors, so a potential contributor (who is familiar with OOoAuthors) would expect that those are the latest iterations awaiting further review or editing. But when looking in the Feedback section for LibO Getting Started on the OOoAuthors site, I find quite a few files with more recent dates than those on the Review List. This suggests to me that when files are updated, the previous version is not being removed from the Review List and the newer version added to it. And it's not clear to me whether the files in Feedback are the latest either.  I found similar issues with the Writer Guide files. Thus there is much room for confusion and potential wasted effort.  If the LibO team is going to use the OOoAuthors website for tracking docs, then I strongly suggest that it be used properly.  If the LibO team is not going to use the OOoAuthors website for this purpose, then two things should be done: (a) the existing files should be deleted from the OOoAuthors site, so they don't mislead people. (b) some other tracking method should be implemented (through the LibO wiki), so potential contributors to LibO docs know what stage various chapters have reached and whether those chapters are being worked on.  I have been talking to someone who is interested in helping out but dismayed by the situation described above. And I was considering updating some of the files with changes I made recently to the OOo docs (correcting errors, clarifying info, adding missing info), but I did not know which files I should use.  --Jean   "

We just need to wait for them to meet with a full quorum and then there can be an *official* decision... I'll follow up this coming Monday unless you have other ideas?  Jean, I'm currently thinking out a possible workflow system for using the wiki, but I'd say we should continue the collaboration with oooauthors... I'll have proposals to put to you all this weekend, probably involving me offering to handle the \"checking-in\" of documents once a work assignment has been done on one of them.

Besides, mediawiki has extension that can  export to odt/pdf any time and make it available for offline reading or printing.  See the example here: http://www.den4b.com/wiki/ReNamer At the time of starting the wiki, I already had written most of the manual in odt format. So I saved the individual chapters in mediawiki format, and pasted them in the wiki pages. I had to upload all figures separately and link them. But on the whole the experience was smooth.

For OOo/LibO user guides (docs aimed at end users, not developers), ODT as a source doc works better (at least in the short term) for these reasons:  1) LibO docs team is using the OOo docs as a starting point, and the OOo docs are in ODT. (The user docs on the OOo wiki are not up to date.)  2) Going from ODT to wiki gives a good layout, but going from wiki to ODT (or PDF) does not; the layout sucks. User guides have too many illustrations, tables, and other features; Mmch fixing up is necessary after export from wiki to ODT if you want a professional looking result.  3) Going from ODT to PDF is easy, and layout is preserved. As stated in (2), going from wiki to PDF gives poor layout that needs much work.  4) Using a wiki does NOT eliminate the proofreading effort. In my experience, using a wiki as the source document results in MORE need for proofreading. Althugh reviewing/editing may be done on the wiki, tracking the changes is not as easy as in ODT; asking questions and getting answers is not as easy; edited wiki pages often/usually need further editing for grammar, comprehension, etc; and much more checking of page layout etc is needed after export to ODT.  5) At OOo most of the people interested in working on user guides say they prefer to work in the ODT files.

I work for a rather large county government and all of our documentation is developed and maintained on our intranet website. All of our documentation is web-based, and only once a year do we export the data and create publishable user guides for training and archival purposes. We've always found it easier to use a web-based documentation platform to collaborate, create, edit, and publish documentation because the documentation will always be up to date. Plus, our users only access this documentation via the intranet website so there is no need for them to search through multiple physical documents. Plus, I think users would rather find all the documentation on a searchable website than to download ODT/PDF files.  I understand the desire to create these ODT files since it's an intuitive method to showcase the capabilities of LibreOffice, but I believe our time could be better spent creating an up to date support site where any of us can edit the documentation. Then, maybe once a year, the data can be copied/exported to ODT as a printable, hard copy of the documentation.  I know most people here will disagree with me, but this is just my $0.02.  Jeff    "

Whether users would rather find info on a website or in downloadable file depends entirely on the users, and that depends a lot on the product and the level of knowledge and experience of the users of that product. My work at OOo suggests that a large number of ordinary users prefer PDFs that they can print out. Others, of course, prefer web-based.  I am also highly dubious that more actual work would be done on the user guides if they were on the wiki instead of in ODT. That has not happened at OOo; there, the writers, editors, and reviewers overwhelmingly prefer to work in ODT, and many of them (including me) are actively unwilling to edit on the wiki.

If from the existing OOo docs, then are you saying they should be wikified before people make the LibO-specific changes? Wikifying existing docs is a lot of work, so it seems to me that the first step should be updating the content of the existing ODTs and then wikifying them. After that, maintenance could occur on the wiki, as you suggest. Personally, I don't think that is a good idea for reasons I stated in previous notes, but the group could choose to go that way.  IMO for the first release of LibO, ideally we would have PDFs and printed books available, as well as info on the wiki. Started from the ODTs is the fastest way to do all of that.

(see their massive catalog here: http://pediapress.com/books/)   Each book is nothing but an exported pdf from wiki. (In fact, all those exported pdfs are available for download free of cost at PediaPress site).   So professional formatting in exported pdfs may not be an issue.   BTW the default setting of the extension is to export pdfs meant for black-n-white PRINTING.   (all text color is stripped, and links are converted to footnotes so that reader can read them).     However, PediaPress shared with us some 12 tweaks that produce pdf files meant for reading on screen.  (The exported pdf has full color text/images, and we can click on its links to jump to another \"marked destination\"/URL.)   Unfortunately in case of ReNamer, we have a shared server, so those tweaks could not be used.  (The changes will affect all other users too.)  But I do have a list of those config changes, which I can share if people are interested. (Basically some parameters are changed in a few Python files at server).  No harm in trying! :)   @point-4: Wiki has built-in DIFF tools to see any version vs any older version.  You can roll back with a single click.  Even changes in images are tracked.  The mother of all wikis, Wikipedia, has other more sophisticated tools for managing wikis. These are available for free download.  In fact, I have found that wiki's \"Discussion\" page is the idea place to ask question, or even to place an alternative mock up of the page. Then other reviewers can compare these alternatives and post their opinion on these versions. Finally we may use one of the versions or a mix of them.  I have actually DONE this in the example provided. :)  BTW these discussion pages are not suitable for intensive proofreading (where multiple people are commenting simultaneously). Reason: They have to keep a track of what the OTHER critiques are saying. This is really strenuous, because you have to open the relevant page of the odt and visualize each comment. Rather than 10 reviewers pouring through their 10 odt files to track each-others' comments, using a wiki is far simpler.  Regards, Narayan     \\t\\t \\t   \\t\\t   "

Well, that's valid only the current version: If Libo is to be \"extensively re-written for contents, and not features\", we may need new docs. Then using a wiki makes sense for a fresh document.  ****** Another important thing to note: All of us agreed that OOo cannot easily export an odt file to wiki.  Does it not strike you as a valid development target for LiBo? LiBo should excel in this area; because wiki (and web in general) will touch many more lives in future!  What is a software if it cannot resolve the pain points of its own help authors?  Please pass on the word to Charles Schulz! :)   -Narayan  \\t\\t \\t   \\t\\t   "

Just to be clear: I don't think ODT is the best medium for providing docs to users, but I do think it is the best medium to use as the source documents from which a variety of outputs (PDF, wiki, print, other) can be derived, thus providing for the needs and preferences of a range of users.   I don't think so. Anecdotal evidence only. IMO no one medium will make everyone happy, because of the wide range of age, experience, computer sophistication, etc among users of office suite software.  One thing that could, and should, influence decisions on how to deliver docs (not how to produce them) is: what audiences is marketing targeting? If marketing is targeting mainly web-savvy groups such as students, then the primary delivery mechanism for information can, and probably should, be different from what might be best for a more diverse or less-savvy audience.  The audience segments that I am most familiar with are, typically, not comfortable doing web lookups (regardless of the format the info is in once they find it) and often do not have a reliable, easy to use, affordable connection to the web. These audience segments include small businesses, small volunteer organisations such as church groups, and seniors (btw, there is a fair overlap between these groups). People in these groups very much need free (in both senses) software, but their information-gathering methods are very different from, say, students or people in in larger businesses.   --Jean     "

(Let him decide for himself.) 2. For the chosen role, the step-by-step process      (For example, how to pick a doc for editing, how to submit it for comments, how comments are collected, how version conflicts are avoided, how the document is deemed to be \"ready\", how to find the templates, how to propose a new document, how to propose a new chapter in an existing document, etc..) 3. Link to a FAQ which each joinee may ask (e.g. \"how do I...?\", \"why not...?\") 4. Links to the source OOo docs, and where the edited \"WIP\" drafts (for LiBo) are to be stored.

As I said above, ODTs and PDFs exported from the wiki are very poor for complex books like the user guides. For example, in addition to other layout problems I mentioned, I now recall that if you aggregate multiple pages into the PDF output, you lose the hierarchy, especially once you include several chapters.  One can export the Wiki to ODT and clean up the result, but the cleanup is a lot of work. I had thought that less work was needed for the OOo Basic Guide, the OOo Admin Guide, and and the Developer's Guide, but I was wrong. The person who does the work says it varies from manageable (on a small doc like the Admin Guide) to a very long process for the large Developer's Guide.  So I repeat what I said earlier: the PediaPress extension to MedaiWiki  may work well with some fairly simple Wiki page sources, but when you have complex formatting the output starts to look VERY amateurish and  unprofessional. There are ways to work around this, but not quickly and easily. Going the other way, from ODT to wiki, is also a lot of work but the results in multiple outputs are much better.  --Jean   "

        "text": "Hi, :-)  I've been reading this thread, and my feelings are somewhat split.  On reflection, as a general idea, I like the idea of having the docs on a wiki, because of the easy availability and searching of all the content. In the fairly near future, LibO's built-in help is going to be wiki-based. If I'm not mistaken about the plans, it will be available within LibO via an interface that fetches from the Web initially and then stores locally.  MSO and Windows has this functionality, and it makes updates easy to provide.  Production-side, it could work if the basic formatting of content is kept simple and complies with some production guidelines.  If we agreed on that, we could be up and working quickly.  I do think we should try to use the material currently available from OOo as a starting point, and should then start writing on our own. In the not-so-far future, the UIs of LibO and OOo are going to diverge to such a point that there won't be sufficient commonality to make it worthwhile trying to write \"one size fits all\" docs anyway.  But:  1) The formatting you can do on a wiki is quite rudimentary. And manual. The writer is faced with the task of being a typesetter at the same time. And the editor has to tread carefully between all the mark-up.  The style sheets currently available on the TDF wiki are quite rudimentary, and would need some adaptation/enhancement/reconfiguration.  2) I've been summarily investigating the availability of workflow management extensions for MediaWiki and haven't found what I hoped for.  Nevertheless, one *could* use the concept of group access to partially manage roles/permissions, combined with a previously-laid-down set of agreed procedures. Even so, basically it would be quite a \"manual\" process that depends a lot on the discipline and cooperation of the team contributors.  Speaking personally, I'm not too much into the idea of \"throwing the doors open to the world\" to get people writing, because *quality* is likely to take a steep dive, or to create a big post-editing workload.  One thing we've got with the material that Jean and Ron have been porting is *truly professional-quality* documentation in terms of the copy (I'm not thinking about the presentation, which is also up to the same level). And my ambition for the LibO project is to maintain that high quality.  3) Michael is very keen on using Drupal as the team's tool. I \"have a date\" with him this week to evaluate what he already has available, and to hear/see - in concrete terms bereft of hype and jargon - what could be developed. My past experience with CMS products tells me that Drupal certainly *could potentially* provide the docs team with tools. But I'm uncertain about who's going to do the development, and about the current progress and expected readiness deadline of that development.  We need a working system *quickly*, so that we can stop debating on the list and actually start producing documentation.  4) Jean has oooauthors.org up and running. I've not taken time out to see the workflow organization much, but I'm pretty sure she's got something acceptable that's already operational.  I must say that it rather gets in my face that it's branded OOo and not LibO, but never mind. I would also prefer it to be a TDF/LibO resource, too, but it's not. However, it does have the advantage that *it exists and works*.  Aside from oooauthors, we don't have *any* automated workflow for working with ODF/ODT files (even though they are in many ways a better starting point for conversions and excellent presentation).  So, as you can see, the issue of \"wiki, ODT or Drupal\" is very much a swings and roundabouts thing.  But I'm starting to drift towards wiki and a Web-based documentation that we then also export to PDF, and that is easily consultable by our users *now*. It's the quickest operational solution, barring Jean's oooauthors.  I'm trying to figure out a workflow that uses the TDF wiki. I've been working on some Linux installation instructions, and on the TDF community bylaws, which has taken most of the free time I have to give the project. But I'll be having some more time in the next few days.  I'm very impatient to get to a point at which I can actually start *producing documentation*. I'm hoping that we're all going to arrive at a consensus quickly, and that we're not all going to be pulling in different directions like a herd of cats.  So much time is wasting, and we have *so little* documentation ready for our users...  I think we need to choose an acting team lead to direct things. I asked Jean, but she's not willing.  I'm offering to take on the role myself.  Would I have your support and cooperation for that? Or are there other candidates?

The reason is the user would mostly jump from a particular screen, and you have to help him about that screen.  On the other hand, a user's manual would have more theory (compared to built-in help) and also a different flow of topics.  So both these documents have to be separate.  Probably Microsoft has tried to solve this by inserting \"All about\" sections in its help file. So while the help screen focuses on the controls of a particular screen, the overall picture is not lost. The user has TWO choices now: He can check what a control does, or understand the entire topic top-down.  *** BTW all this discussion means LibO should make it a priority development target to be compatible with such web-based documentation.  Regarding the \"online vs offline\" debate, I have seen the following arguments:  Why online: 1. The time of offline editors like MSO and OOo has come and gone (in favor of online editors like Google Docs and MSO live) 2. The netbooks and pads will force people towards online editors.  Why offline: 1. Most/many countries and regions don't have enough bandwidth, or reliable connection,  2. Many users have or their lifestyle forces them to have only intermittent access to net. 2. Even if the net is accessible, many people can't afford the cost.   So catering to both types of users would mean making a documentation system that is convertible. This conversion may not be \"live\": For example, wikipedia does the wiki-to-pdf conversion periodically. On the other hand, there is the PediaPress approach (convert your own odt/pdf ; or Print-on-demand).  Regards, Narayan    \\t\\t \\t   \\t\\t   "

To make some *effective* progress with producing the large amount of documentation that is currently lacking, someone needs to become acting documentation team lead until such time that TDF makes an official appointment.  I have 25 years of professional experience working with technical documentation. I have only been involved in LibreOffice since the TDF launch, but I have been doing some writing, proofreading and reviewing for the project over the past couple of months. I am concerned and care about the current state of inactivity and disarray in documentation work.  I offer to taken on the leadership and coordination of the team until that time. Florian Effenberger has agreed to grant me wiki administrator rights, so I will be able to do things such as reorganize the documentation pages, move pages, protect pages, delete pages, undelete pages and various other actions necessary for establishing a workflow for the docs team.  I plan to organize regular team phone conferences, and to listen carefully to the ideas and opinions that team members voice. But then, after that, when a decision needs to be taken in order to allow tangible progress with the team's work, I plan to announce a decision and to proceed with whatever action is necessary to make it happen.  Obviously, I can't do all the work by myself, and I am hoping that team members will feel that it's worthwhile to cooperate and contribute, and that a significant number of you will also take part in the work with me.  If anyone feels that they are better qualified to take on this role, and is willing to put significant time and work into the project to make things really start happening, then please do speak up, and we can let meritocracy and natural democracy decide the issue. If there are other candidates, we can organize a vote by team members. (Let's define a team member as someone who speaks up in this thread, and who is willing to actually work on documentation, not just lurk silently or unproductively flame and distract the debate.)  I have already approached some SC members. They told me that the organization is not yet there to make any official appointment, but that there is no reason why I can't take on the role on an acting basis, if I can convince team members to work with me. So I have *some* kind of tacit approval to try and make this work. Let's say that my understanding is that they will stand back and watch what develops. And then at a later date they will make their official decisions as they see fit. But this is certainly *not* an officially-approved initiative.

If you feel you're a better candidate, then please speak up and tell us *why* and what your concretely propositions are. In that case, I hope you're willing to back that up by contributing lots of active work and time to the project. Because I promise that *I* am.  If you actively disapprove of my initiative, then respond with -1.  If you lurk and say nothing, I will consider that I have your tacit approval.

Maybe a localisation team representative can join us on the next documentation call to discuss their needs and you can explain how the system will be implemented. Clearly there can't be a different system for every language, however as we discussed, if this were to be transitioned to the Drupal site under development some time in the future I am sure that editorial quality and localisation teams would be very happy with the outcome.  I would love to be able to try out some of the editing systems sooner rather than later as we are quickly approaching launch of 3.3 with an RC out already. Could some people on the documentation team get access to write?  Martin Srebotnjak wrote:  There are no 'big guns' in the LibreOffice project as has been discussed within the Steering Committee and on many other conference calls. However there are too many localisation teams to discuss and decide with every one regarding infrastructure, which would likely result in duplication and un-coordinated systems. AFAIK there is an understanding that if people are interested in 'how' something is implemented such as documentation, websites, marketing, etc. they join the appropriate team who makes an informed decision while requesting input from stakeholders. It is a simple flat structure which with collaboration between groups should work very well, as is happening with the Drupal website that is being developed. I can't see this being any different.  The Drupal team is working hard to ensure that no matter what language you will be able to contribute to these core infrastructure teams when the site is launched early next year.

From previous posts, I think it has been decided to start off with the published OOo 3.3 docs and redo the work we've done on the LibO docs that are there. Partly because the OOo docs are more updated and make a better starting point, but also because there are some issues with the LibO files that I've been working on (explained earlier) that make it necessary to start afresh.  You might want to check with David, but I think the next steps are to take an OOo chapter and start porting it while incorporating any worthwhile changes we've made so far to the LibO docs.

Instead, I recommend that Michael should set up a GraphMind (http://drupal.org/project/graphmind) on his Drupal site, and then we can create the mindmap for this subject.

Which tools facilitate online collaborative authoring     (This includes editing, comments, diff function that compares ANY two versions, acceptance/rejection of changes, rollback) 4. Which tools allow conversion to offline manuals that can be read on screen. 5. Which tools allow conversion to printable books with excellent formatting.  Once these choices and their relative strengths and weaknesses are known, we can then allow voting.  BTW I think not many people are even aware of Michael's Australian website.

Further, all authors would have to agree on common set of tools so that they can collaborate. (Each author can not insist on using his own tool; otherwise there will be compatibility issues later.)  The choice of authoring tool should not be finalized based on the preference of a few early joiners. It should be based on a thorough analysis and comparison of the available tools.  Since that conference call didn't materialize to finalize the authoring tool, then the next option is the website.  In fact, if Drupal itself has a powerful books module which can be export as viewable OR printable pdf.  Thus \"website\" and \"documentation\" are not isolated concepts. In fact, regardless of the authoring tool chosen, the LibO website will execute the workflow partly or fully. So the web team is very much a facilitator/enabler for the documentation team. Therefore the web team and the documentation team would have to work together.   I don't know what you mean, but no one is going to develop any tool, right? The authors will simply make use of an existing offline/online application or service. Say, one of the options is for you to install the Drupal book module.  -Narayan  \\t\\t \\t   \\t\\t   "

Since all are volunteers, any forced standardization is a risk. So the points raised by Sophie are important: there will be people willing to help only if they can do it \"the usual way\".

When OOo authoring started, many of the collaborative authoring tools were not so sophisticated.   OOo authors may be having their legacy issues.

If I were to put myself in the position of a first time user of LibO and was directed to that page, I would literally say \"you gotta be joking !\". What use is an online help system in a wiki that doesn't show index links to the main topics. This is a minimum for any help system. As for the search engine, well, I've never been very impressed with most of the search engines used in default wiki implementations.  The user must be given the possibility to browse through the pages of help via links that appear, as they did in the \"inline\" help system of OOo, otherwise as far as I'm concerned it is absolutely useless. If and when the user comes across a topic for which they know the keyword to search for, then they could of course use the search engine to enhance their browsing experience, but IMHO you can not forego the immediate visual need of a user. An example to look to in this case would be the API documentation of OOo, yes, you can search for the terms using the search engine that Collabnet provided, but you can also drill down via links through the various API descriptions.   Whilst I appreciate that it must have taken a lot of work to get this up onto the wiki, IMHO the visual accessibility of the information really needs to be addressed.   Alex    "

There have been many postings on many of the TDF mailing lists about Drupal, but - in reality - there has been no official decision to adopt a Drupal site at the moment, not for documentation and not for anything else. No official decision could be taken before The Document Foundation [TDF] has a board of directors, at which time the board of directors will take any such decision.  As for the handling of documentation by a Drupal site, that would first depend on a decision being taken to adopt Drupal as a tool for the docs team. That, in itself, is far from being a foregone conclusion. Other solutions exist (use the wiki, etc.).

Even a Drupal-based workflow could involve several quite different options.

If there is a need to access, edit and republish documents under development through a native file system network folder I would we suggest we go towards leveraging these tools and move away from the work that has been done already. On the other hand we could use a version control system just like the development team does with GIT when working on and submitting source code, and Drupal supports this without the need for additional applications which would also support native file system support you are describing.  On both counts however it requires an end user to learn another system, unlike the point and click type of system that OOoAuthors has and I have been working towards on Jean's advice.

We'll see what happens in that respect in due course.  I think what I can more usefully do is to offer myself as an \"acting central contact\".  I can be there to be contacted by and liaise with outside parties wanting to make contact with docs people. Then I can relay communication to the docs team, and channel back any reactions from docs contributors.  I can act as a spokesperson for the docs team, when needed, by listening to the docs contributors and gaging the general consensus/streams of opinion and relaying that to outside parties (the SC, etc.).  I can be there for docs contributors needing guidance or a central figure to communicate with about their contributions. In particular, if you have a wiki-related problem, I have full admin powers and am there to help you out. Same applies for the upcoming LibreOffice website.

However, it sounds like you think that role should be more managerial. Perhaps that is because you come from a work situation where team members are required to follow their manager's lead? My experience has been more with groups of volunteers, where motivating people is high on the list for a leader but there is less expectation that people will carry out the leader's decisions.

        "text": "Hi Sophie,    I have subscribed to the l10n mailing list just on Friday, after I learned that there were some discussions there I was not aware of until then.  Now, the explanation about wikihelp.  As you may recall, the conclusion was described as:  \\tcreate help-packs - split out the help for each language \\tand simply have no help installed[1], but a web link to on-line \\thelp[2], and a \"download your help-pack here\" direction \\t\\t+ not even English help would be installed - \\t\\t  this will save us 11Mb in the 170Mb download  Also, each and every release notes of betas and even RC1 contained a note \"The help content is not included. We are working on the online version. Alternatively, it will be possible to install it separately.\"  It is my mistake that I did not explain the exact way to implement it in advance, I am sorry for that.  So let me explain why wikihelp:  Wiki is so far the best free tool for collaboration editing I know of. It gives anyone the freedom to improve things.  With help implemented as a wiki, any user of the suite can (potentially) just describe the functionality better, should he/she find out that something is described wrongly, or just partially.  Also, why should be your native language just a translation of an English help?  Should you have people that can improve the help, but cannot speak English, why should they be bound to translating only, when they can author the text?  Why should be the French help just a translation of an English help, when it can be an own (better?) version?  This is why I believe implementing the help as a wiki is the best thing to do.  How does it work:  - for 3.3, I am converting the .xhp files into wiki markup   - it is now online as http://help.libreoffice.org   - missing translations yet, I need to polish the tooling first   - when the tooling is right, I'll add 2-3 more languages, for more     testing   - when even that approved, I'll upload the rest  - anything untranslated in the localized versions will be marked   appropriately   - a template for that, like {{NeedsTranslation}} + the English version  - after the import is done, and people are happy with it, it will be   open for account creation   - for now, please ask me directly if you want to have an account     there, to edit pages like Main_Page, or Template:*   - other pages might get rewritten by the import tooling  - after 3.3, I'll start to work on tooling to convert it back to offline   help   - to platform native help system     - Windows/Linux/MacOSX   - from the engineering point of view, we don't want a home-grown help     system, as we have now   - needs more research, to see if we don't lose features etc.  - when done, the wikihelp becomes the authoritative version of the help   - but we'll still be able to incorporate changes from the .xhp files,     when merging from OOo   - we can agree that some of the localized versions would be locked for     editing, and just taken from .xhp and .sdf files, but I _strongly_     advise against that  Open questions:  - extended tips   - cannot be part of the wikihelp, most probably these have to be     handled separately, and translated using the normal process  - anything else?   As you might have noticed, anybody can ask for the git account, and anybody with a bigger contribution is offered with write access.   Oh?  Were you following what we are doing on the development mailing list?  The last months, we have spent days and nights reviewing and fixing patches from new people.   Why do you think that people want to break your work?  Do you really think that making something yourself is more effective than just reviewing someone else's work?  How could it scale, if you were doing everything yourself?   Yes, will do, and sorry again that I haven't summarized all this before. If you can point me to the messages I probably missed due to not being subscribed to the l10n@ ML, that would be most appreciated.  Thank you, Kendy   "

There are many technical solutions possible, including uploading the English wikihelp pages to pootle (so far it is done per paragraph anyway), and having chosen languages read-only in wikihelp, generated from the English version + pootle.   Maybe I am entering a thin ice here, but do not think we have a good help as of now.  There is so few information there, in many times in the form \"'Insert Picture' functionality inserts a picture from a file.\" ;-)  We need to grow the family of the documentation writers, and we cannot do that by using the current tools.  Authoring the .xhp files as we have now has a terribly steep learning curve (see the description of the xml language that is used for that, or the description of how to use the extension for the help authoring http://documentation.openoffice.org/online_help/helpers/helpauthoring/guide/OOo2HelpAuthoring.pdf).  So we need to do the work easier not only for the translators, but for the help authors, or the documentation team in general, too.  And I believe that with wiki, this has the biggest potential to scale.   I am sorry I haven't stressed this enough still: For 3.3, I am just importing the help to the wikihelp, there is no change in your processes.   It is again solvable, it is easy to provide dumps of the wiki (believe it or not, bzipped it has only about 1.4M per language), for the offline grepping.   I think the biggest issue is the offline editing; and I think here we can use the Wiki Publisher (http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/wikipublisher)  to edit the pages in LibreOffice.  I did not test it yet, but if the extension misses the functionality to merge the changes done in the wiki, it will be easy to plug it to LibreOffice document merge feature.   It is just up to the wiki setup - we can of course have a group of admins who will be giving rights just to the selected people, etc.   Understood - please see my other mail to JBF about fighting spam.   I see, OK.   No, it does not have to be open to everybody, even the account creation can be restricted to selected group of people only.   Sorry, I missed yours, if you mean \"HC2 l10n process\" :-(  The best is to CC: me explicitly if you need the answer quickly, normally I just scan the ML subjects quickly, read the interesting ones, and read the rest of the messages later in batches.

We are not going to impose something on you that you don't want; and we can't make the decisions in a vacuum, we're part of the same family - so lets try to collect requirements together in a friendly way :-) If you have some, please knock up a wiki page with them. Some are quite interesting, eg. the French localisation legislation is fascinating and a new concept to me at least.   \\tSo - there is no need to open the wiki for editing ever, if that is a huge problem for people, and certainly we don't have to do this for 3.3, and certainly we don't have to open the wiki so just anyone can turn up from the street and spam it :-) [ it is easy to have approved translators only eg. ]. We can provide solutions for off-line editing, and there is certainly no need to switch tooling to make the wiki the authoritative data source now / yesterday :-) we can do that in a month / never if there is some insuperable problem.  \\tAnyhow, I suspect there are perhaps three problems here, none of them truly technical:  \\tA. People are paranoid about developers dictating new tools \\t   to them that do not meet their needs / quality \\t\\t+ but this isn't going to happen \\t\\t+ and hassling people providing new options is not the \\t\\t  best way to have your requirements considered :-)  \\tB.

We should have a simple, light version accessible via Pootle for localization to be distributed with or along the product, what is currently called HC2. A more documented part available to the localization team via Pootle but optional because not part of the product, the wikihelp.

I guess from all the discussion here we see that the LO developers and documentation team wish to get help onto a new platform, where it will be easier to maintain.  On the other hand the localization teams who have invested big resources into translating the huge help system wish to continue working like before in a Pootle or similar environment.  I propose you develop a system to have English help editable on wiki but fully transportable back to the po/xliff system (interchangeable). All the translations would start from the English po/xliff help files and decide whether to a) strictly translate English help (like we Slovenians decided) and keep working with po/xliff files; the online help would be updated from these files at least with every minor and major release; or b) develop their own help in the wiki and never go back again;  Before I go on I need an answer to a question. I tried the help in RC1 and it seems that help items do not get passed to wiki i.e. the default module help page opens even if you press F1 in a certain dialog (the previous bundled help showed that definite topic in the help). Is this how the wiki help is envisioned? If it is, one need a lot of searching to even get to a certain topic and this makes the help totally unusable. If this is the case the wiki help should only be a web version of the bundled help, just a copy made after every release from the release translations.  Lp, m.  "

And finally, dear documentation team, I'm sure we will soon have good knowledge on how to use those new and unavoidable features our developers have designed with the help of your nice writings :-)  I would like to thank every body for the great work that has been already done and will be done for our first version all together :-)  [1] http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Marketing/LibOReleaseEvents/LOPressKit/FeatureList3.3  Kind regards Sophie "

Otherwise the lang teams will not ok the release thus only the English version will be an official and tested release, and all the rest will be untested. Think what that means for adoption of LO in enterprises and government sector. Not good at all. For all other languages 3.3 seems to be a preview what a LO will look like in 3.4, and not a full featured version, a kind of LO beta.   This is a very good question.  In the current implementation, I do not  The transport of (English) help from wiki back to xliff/po must get all the keywords references, links etc. How is that handled? Will the index in LO offline help work after such a backport from wiki? This is of major importance. Offline help without index and table of contents etc. is not usable.  Kendy, why do you have to rush at this online solution for 3.3? I propose to leave things as with OOo for 3.3, with help packs as separate downloads if they are too big to be included in the international package. In the meantime you can get the conversion procedures working so that no metadata from help gets lost and on the road to 3.4 all the teams and LO projects decide about the future of LO help system. What you are driving at is having a non-fully-working solution for 3.3 with already some decision in place at very short notice (and such decisions mostly lead to headache) and then decide for future. What I propose is a fully working solution for 3.3 with enough time later to decide and make a new system working fully for the 3.4 release.  Lp, m.  "

Also installing LO on multiple systems should provide option to install also the langpacks (I believe that is possible now, but maybe some more automation should be provided, given that it is two packages that need to be installed, not just one, the fully localized build, as with OOo).

The installer would then run in that language and automatically offer GUI and dictionaries of that language as presets, and offer the appropriate help package download.  I prefer language selection based on user selection and not on the OS language, because some users have English GUI in OS, but want a localized LO.  Example: if I am Slovenian, I would select Slovenian language, the installer GUI would be Slovenian, the defaults for installation would be Slovenian GUI and Slovenian and English dictionaries. If I would want to manually change the things to install I would still be able to select and deselect other languages etc. And at the end of installation I would be warned that help is only online and that for offline help I must follow the given link to the Slovenian helppack.

        "text": "Hi Hal, :-)   The prime mover behind oooauthors.org is Jean Weber, who is a really dedicated contributor with valuable editor and publishing experience. I must admit I have great regard for her. She would make a perfect team lead for documentation for LibreOffice, but does not feel like taking on the role.  My personal reasons for not yet being convinced that oooauthors.org is the best place to centralize the LibreOffice docs team work are these:  1) There are products that should be evaluated, such as Alfresco (http://www.alfresco.com/), which might be a more up-to-date approach to collaborating on documentation.  2) Oooauthors.org is, AFAIK, hosted on consumer-grade hosting, yet houses a very large database with lots of essential information, and the fruits of contributors' hard work (as far as documentation is concerned). AFAIK, the database is never backed up. If, for any reason, the site went belly up, we'd be sunk. The site itself seems to need a *little* technical love and attention - people sometimes encounter little glitches.  Really, it would be better if the site were moved to the TDF/OOodevs De server, where it would be administered by experienced geeks who would solve all the problems and keep things safe. But that won't happen unless the domain name changes to a TDF domain, and oooauthors.org does not agree to that. So there seems to be a deadlock there at the present time.  3) I feel that the LibreOffice documentation project would do better to develop its own workflow, without being bound to an outside party such as oooauthors.org (or even odfauthors.org, or whatever). This is partly a matter of pure prejudice, but also because I feel we should have all our expertise \"in-house\". I wish Jean would make the switch and join us 100%...  At the present time, there seems to be no clear consensus about these things among contributors. The only real consensus among docs contributors *who actually do work* for LibreOffice seems to be that ODT/ODF should be the central medium for production, with other formats being provided as well for final output.   This is a problem. At the moment, any kind of organized work on docs is entirely dependent on people being sufficiently disciplined to update the few pages we have keeping track of docs changes. It *can* be done via the wiki, but the wiki is not a really good medium for changes management, workflow automation, etc.  Attention is urgently needed to this problem.   LibreOffice aims to be meritocracy-driven. The guy who actively starts doing the work gets to lead the way. Therefore, if you've time and inclination to take a lead role in this, and you have ideas that get a consensus of agreement after consulting the team, you can make the difference. So feel free to take action. The only point I'm trying to make is that it is better to consult the other contributors first, and get *some kind* of green light.  I have full wiki admin permissions, so if there's anything I can do to assist you or facilitate things, feel free to contact me on- or off-list, and I will do my utmost to cooperate.  I'm concerned about these issues, like you. But for the next week or so, I'm putting a lot of work into the libreoffice.org website which, IMHO, is an even more urgent need. So I've temporarily put on hold my own efforts to address exactly the same issues you're talking about. But I *will* be thinking more about this. ;-)   They're cats, mate! :-D They all run in different directions! The LibreOffice SC is currently seems to be applying a policy of \"hacker anarchy\" and laissez-faire. So it's not easy to organize things. If you think you can manage it, go for it, I'd say.   You're quite right. I see that Ron Faile has given you valuable pointers. Ron is one really good contributor to the docs project: he works and doesn't talk much, and is perfectly willing to cooperate with people. All the documentation we currently have has Ron's hand in there somewhere.  If possible, try to avoid changing the file names of the GS guide. I've linked to them from the upcoming libreoffice.org website. If you upload files, please could you always leave the old versions there for the moment, just in case we ever need to roll back for some unforeseen reason?   You're a man after my own heart, then, and you'll be a welcome and valuable addition to the documentation team.  I look forward to actively doing the same when libreoffice.org is online.  But, if you do have ideas, please do tell us about them. Maybe you can help us bring order to the current chaos.  David Nelson  "

This gets an additional state of `back'. `No'== no second person has seen it. `Back'== a second person has seen it, but has edits and `Yes'== a second person has seen it and it's ready to progress to the next step.  The third column is renamed to `proofing' and follows the same logic as `feedback'. When it's state is `Yes' though, it is signed off in the fourth column, `publish'. This means it's ready to have the EDIT tag removed. We would need to add a 5th column for sign out.

Some native-lang groups will produce its own documentation, some others will translate what is available in en_US language or other languages, and sometime it will be both.  For the FR project, I'm currently testing some tools for the translation of the OOoAuthors Guides.  Translating on the wiki is horrible, I've translated two guides and they are now completely obsolete and not in sync with the rest so it's a waste of time finally.  With the .odt files we can use translating tools, glossaries and translation memory. I'm testing WordForge as the local translation tool currently (it manages odt -> xliff -> odt), and I think also to use Pootle to organize the workflow (you can assign roles and tasks, you know the amount of work is remaining, it's easy to check for errors like missing translation, double punctuation or missing caps, extra space, etc, you can work on line or off line and it handles xliff files).  Would you be interested by this workflow at an i18n level, or do I go on only with the FR group here? This question because it needs more testing (will do after the 3.3 is out), and some styles (the low level ones it seems) will have to be adapted in the .odt file for conversion purpose to .xlf files. So it might be interesting to adapt it to your current workflow and requirements too.  Kind regards Sophie   "

I'm not too sure precisely how we can work i18n into our own workflow... If you have specific suggestions then I'd be interested to hear.  One package I'm currently interested in is Alfresco... I plan to experiment with it between Christmas and New Year... Maybe there is a possibility with this tool that we *could* design a more integrated workflow with interested i18n teams...

In the past, I have created some of my own documentation for the OOo project, and then translated it myself, however, translating other works has always been a right royal PITA. I originally posted the following wishlist on the French discussion list the other day :  - be able to translate an *ODF* file in such a way that homogenous vocabulary terms are used throughout (e.g. using a translation memory, glossary) ;  - be made aware automatically that there has been a change in the original language document from which the translation was made;  - be able to easily collaborate on a translation, be it by division of labour (e.g. segmentation),  or through proof-reading / copy / revision writing, and being automatically made aware thereof, each time a change occurs ;  - not having to be online to be able to do the work : one of the banes of most of the solutions I have seen proposed so far is the requirement to be online to actually work on a document - please do not make this an obligation, not all of us live online or have permanent access; the corollary of this possibility, is also being able to update the work done once an online connection is available again;  - when a new document is put online, being made aware of that fact via an automatic notification (e-mail ?) what I like about the Silverstripe CMS at the moment is that I am made aware each time a change is made to the site for which I have publishing rights - this is a superb piece of functionality as far as I'm concerned ;  - be able to tell others simply and efficiently that I have reserved a document or that others have reserved a document to work on - ideally, this would be proposed automatically.   Maybe these requirements are impossible at the moment with the solutions available to us, but something like that would be far more motivating than anything I've had the unfortunate displeasure to use so far :-p  Alex   "

Also, sometimes these office suites are distributed via CD's with other OSS software or included in an OS, so there is no download page to see this warning.

I have bookmarked your email regarding the requirements for international documentation, and I will add it to the growing list of requirements for the documentation development and revision work flow. These are clearly infrastructure demanding requirements, and we will be investigating ways to meet these requirements, unfortunately I can't give you any straight answers at the moment as we require some time to digest and discuss how these could be implemented within Drupal.  To be clear, there has not been any decision to use Drupal as the primary documentation development tool, but once we have established the work flow and determined a way to coordinate this across languages we will be putting the system up for the assessment of the documentation and localisation/native language teams.  Thank you for the very clear and concise summary of some of the ideals. Personally I would love to see a system which does not favour any language, and developments in any language can be propagated through the documentation of all languages for the benefit of the entire community.

But, she explained, in LibreOffice, there is a drive towards giving each NL project independence in producing its own content, in the form it thinks is best - even though an English version of a content may be offered as a possible working base, if the NL project wants to adopt a \"translation-based\" approach rather than an \"own-creation\" approach.  You can see this in the SilverStripe website, on which each NL project gets a sub-site that it's free to structure and people with content as it sees fit. For example, the French or German NL projects are not in any way obliged to have a site structure that is a \"clone\" of the English structure. They might adopt a quite different IA for communicating with their user base and servicing its needs.  (I must say that I rather like these ideas.)  So we'd be looking for a system that caters to this autonomy.  HTH.  P.S. When we're talking about NL, we're talking about *languages* not \"national/political\" boundaries.  David Nelson  "

The funny thing is, that pictures (\"the\" media content\") won't get updated within this dialog - so it would be somehow incorrect. I assume that it is the same for videos and sounds.  Then, I miss the reason for asking - it is implicitly contained in \"most recent content\", although the external data might not have changed in the meantime. And what happens if the user does not update all the links?  Then I'd like to ask whether you plan for different buttons and/or dialog titles - or is this the default Yes/No behavior? If yes, then the user would get the important information in the second part. It is usually recommended to provide it as early as possible. That's e.g. the reason for the \"self-speaking\" buttons. (I agree that LibO/OOo still misses such specific dialog guidelines like the Gnome HIG or stuff Apple/Microsoft/... provides.)  The last sentence \"Go to Edit ...\" is I'd like to see in the help (referring to a sub-section to the , but not in the dialog itself.

We are a very young community, and as such just starting to develop this infrastructure. If you wish to translate the existing English documentation into Hindi I am sure we will be able to integrate with the infrastructure when it has been commissioned. Our current workflow has only been established for the English documentation, however I am personally working on a proposal to truly internationalise the documentation development.  If you wish to put in the effort to translate the documentation into Hindi prior to the LibreOffice 3.3 launch I would suggest downloading the ODT of the file you want to translate, then using Google Translate to create a first pass, very rough translation of the PDF file available on the wiki. You could then copy the translated text back into the English ODT file in order to maintain official formatting, tables, images and figures, from which you could modify the text to suit the Hindi user base. Although there has been no official decision, I would expect that the documentation team requires that formatting, layout, colours must remain the same across languages (Localised fonts excepted, but if substituted, an open font would be much preferred).  An example of using Google Translate to create a first pass is: http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=en&amp;tl=hi&amp;u=http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/cgi_img_auth.php/c/c2/0101GS3-IntroducingLibO.pdf Simply go to http://translate.google.com Paste the web address of the PDF file into the box and press translate.  I would strongly advise against 'creating your own' documentation, as has been suggested, as this would most likely not integrate well with the official documentation workflow once established.

        "text": "Hi Michael, Sophie, Kinshuk, all, :-)  @Michael: you're quite right that the English documentation team hasn't chosen its tools and workflow yet, and I know you're currently working on ideas for us all to examine together. I'm looking forward to that. ;-)  @Kinshuk: It's true that TDF and the LibreOffice project were only recently launched *as a separate entity* from OpenOffice.org. But the actual community *behind* LibreOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) and the software have existed for 10 years, and many of the people now contributing to the LibreOffice community are veterans with many years of experience.  With regard to NL teams: NL (native language) teams and communities are not in any way obliged to adopt the same workflow or tools as the English documentation team. They are totally free to decide on their own approach to localization of the software, documentation production and other things, too.  For instance, the libreoffice.org website is set up so that NL teams can develop their own NL site with total independence from the English site, as regards structure (\"information architecture\") and page content.  NL teams are not at all obliged to follow a \"translation-based\" approach to either documentation or their NL site. If they feel that their particular community is better served by developing their own content, they are free to do so.  As regards localization of the software, obviously NL teams are going to be translating the English strings into their own language. But there are various tools and workflows one could use for that translation process and, here again, NL teams have total freedom of choice: you could do it online with Pootle, or offline with OmegaT or Poedit, or simply using an appropriate text editor, to name but *some* of the possibilities.  For instance, in the English documentation team, we're about to start evaluating Alfresco (I've now got a sandbox site set up, by the way, and we can start on assessing that anytime from this week onwards). But that doesn't impose any obligations on NL teams to follow in our footsteps.  Of course, some NL teams might adopt a translation-based approach for their resources (documentation, NL site, LibreOffice help, wiki content, ...). In this case, TDF has all the facilities you need for that, and the English docs team already has a quantity of high-quality documentation that you can translate (we're working on producing much more, too).  My personal experience with machine translation is that it *can* be a time saver in certain very particular cases. But it does not work at all well with most of the content we have to deal with. The quality of results also varies according to the target language, and the effort that has been put into developing the translation memory. Current translation systems usually use a statistical approach rather than a rule-based approach, and I can tell you with mirth and glee that human translators are *not yet* close to being replaced by computers. :-D  To summarize about machine translation: it can end up giving you more work than if you translate manually, especially if you care about *quality*. Usually best avoided.  When you're thinking \"internationalization\" in the LibreOffice community, we have a \"native language\" paradigm rather than a nationality-based approach. For instance, the French NL community services all the French-speaking countries and communities (parts of Belgium, parts of Canada, France, various countries in Africa, ...). For English, we service Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the US and various other places and communities (we don't yet have the resources to manage different varieties of English).  For India, you can well understand the reasons for this thinking.  Only in marketing are things somewhat different. Marketing is much more country- and region-based. This is because there are notable differences between the context in, for instance, the UK and the context in the US. Indeed, marketing can address markets that englobe other national/community markets - that's the case in Europe, for example, with the EU being one marketing target in addition to the national states it contains.  Well, that turned into quite an essay! :-D  HTH. ;-)  David Nelson  "

I have built the idea from the documentation workflow that Jean proposed we use from the OOoAuthors site, including an editing and review process for every proposed change regardless of language.  I am not sure what direction language teams have taken regarding documentation and if this proposal fits in with any existing plans, could someone comment on this?  I would appreciate feedback to the open questions at the end of the document, if you have a constructive opinion, I am more than happy to adapt the approach if something is more appropriate / better outcome.  Thanks all for the positive input and support so far with the Documentation Team. Michael Wheatland  "

I had a quick look at it.  2010/12/26 Michael Wheatland :  To answer some of your open questions:  We should also have a look at pootle, since Sophie is running a test to use it for translation purposes (see her announcement here: http://go.mail-archive.com/Hn9qvZS2yGYyXSWq7P0JtElbvo0=> ). Pootle is a tool, that is known to many translators, so it might be useful to take it into account as well. We'll see what the result is of this test.  Btw, I'm not sure, that Jean recommended using the Wiki for developing the documentation. I would say it was more the opposite. :)  I would like to have a common template among all the languages, so I'm in favour of this idea.  For having the same structure: I think, the headings are chosen to have a logical layout and flow of the text. So in my opinion, it would make sense to have a similar structure in the other languages as well. But I would not force other language teams to have the same structure. Maybe there is a good reason, why they want to change it.  So I'll stop here for now - if I have more to say, I'll send another mail. ;)  Sigrid  "

For my part, I've set-up an Alfresco web at https://documentation.traduction.biz, and I'll be proposing this to the docs team for evaluation and testing. I'll be making an announcement about that within 24 hours.  I'm hoping that it will be administered by Ron Faile and - if she's willing to take part in this experiment - Jean Weber. I'll be getting more involved in it after January 10 2011, because I'm currently busy on re-theming the libreoffice.org website and further developing the content there, and will be presenting the site to the SC on that date.  If, after this evaluation, it happens that Alfresco is seen as a useful working tool for the LibreOffice docs team, I'll be asking Florian and Christian if they can give us an Alfresco web on the TDF/Ooodev De server, because LibreOffice working resources should ideally be hosted and operated on TDF-run infrastructure.  So it will be interesting to compare the two options side by side and see which is seen as a preferred working platform.  David Nelson  "

I have heard great things about Plone, very powerful and fast content management framework, but as I understand it there is a lot of custom coding involved.  Did the original conversation about Plone discuss how we would implement the workflow? Having the discussions with Jean early on regarding the infrastructure, I was under the understanding that the instance of Plone setup on OOoAuthors did not have a structured workflow, but rather folders with permissions. The discussions we have had so far is pointing towards structured cross-language collaboration, so as we have discussed previously, the tooling should meet the workflow needs rather than the other way around.  I am very keen to see Alfresco up and running, as we have discussed a few times. The Alfresco framework ties in very well with Drupal and together they provide an incredibly powerful document management system. I think someone pointed out the limitation of cross-language collaboration (I might be wrong here, I have not personally had experience with Alfresco in a multi-language environment).  Also, might I suggest that we refrain from using the TDF servers as a testing ground as this may lead to a misconception that we have decided on using the tool for the documentation workflow. The intermediate workflow, on the wiki, as discussed seems to be working quite well at the moment, albeit without permissions.  Thanks, Michael Wheatland  "

        "text": "Hi Michael, :-)  Thanks for this input and creative thinking. Objective examination of contrasting ideas is a great way to identify the best way forward.  I've read your presentation and sat there thinking about your ideas, but I don't think we hit the jackpot yet. Let me explain why.  1) Your system sees documentation and other i18n-able content being processed within a unified work process. You yourself alluded to the complexity of such a system. I see that as a problem because a) it will take quite some time and considerable development work to implement, and b) it will impose a degree of technical expertise and a learning curve on i18n and English docs people that might be beyond many.  2) Your system deprives i18n teams/individuals of the current flexibility and freedom of action that is one of the founding principles behind TDF. They would be obliged to work as \"minions\" (said with a *big* *humorous* smile) of a \"big machine\" that does not let them address and implement any NL-specific needs and approaches.  We have to bear in mind that i18n is done by teams ranging in size from one solitary individual to a number of contributors, and they have varying degrees of technical expertise, as well as varying degrees of willingness to learn new systems that would get imposed on them. IMHO, by offering people total freedom of action, but backed up by a good level of support if they want to adopt existing workflows, tools and content, we are likely to draw-in a lot more contributors ot the community of communities.  To better explain what I mean, I refer you to my recent post explaining TDF's i18n policy, such as I have come to understand it (see [1]).  My humble suggestion would be to keep thinking, but focus on a workflow for the English documentation team. If we really come up with something that is a real winner, it is likely to be naturally adopted by at least *some* i18n teams. But, IMHO, a \"standardized\", \"global\", \"factory\" approach is unlikely to win widespread support.  While you're thinking, I'd invite you to evaluate the current options up for discussion:  1) Andreas Mantke's and Jean Weber's work on their Plone-based web;  2) The Alfresco evaluation sandbox I've got installed at https://documentation.traduction.biz which might work for the \"English docs\" team and for any i18n teams interested in collaborating closely with \"English docs\", whether on a \"translation-based\" approach or on an \"own content creation\" approach (or a mixture of the two);  3) A wiki-based approach;  3) Any other system you see as advantageous (which I am betting would be Drupal-based :-D ).

I am proposing this for evaluation by the English documentation team, and any interested i18n people, as one option among the other possibilities presently under consideration:  1) using the Plone-based web currently primarily operated by Jean Weber, with technical support from Andreas Mantke;  2) using the TDF wiki, as is now the case.  I won't have much time for this before January 10, due to other work I'm doing.  My suggestion would be that Jean Weber could be an admin on the Alfresco site, and that we could try processing 1, 2 or 3 chapters of the Writer Guide on it, to see what Alfresco's merits and weaknesses are. (I had hoped Ron Faile would also be another admin, but I think he's busy on the core work of the docs team - producing documentation.)  If ever Alfresco was seen as a possible viable tool after initial evaluation, I would ask Florian and Christian if they could set us up an Alfresco installation on the TDF server infrastructure, which is the natural place for a tool used by the LibreOffice English docs team. Any data already accumulated by that time could be migrated by Christian with full support from me. So we can start actually doing useful work on the https://documentation.traduction.biz web any time from now on, without any wastage of collaborative effort.  I will be doing some work on my Alfresco sandbox myself, but it won't be much of an evaluation of its collaborative capabilities if no-one else does some actual documentation work there. So I would encourage other active docs team members to ask me for an account there and try it out, even if your predispositions are leaning towards other options. ;-)  And I would then invite you to center your Alfresco-related discussion mainly on *this* thread, so we can pool our ideas and reactions.

Also this has been removed but I believe it should be noted somewhere because that will brake the extensions database for the users who want to downgrade to a OOo 3.2 version : The Berkeley database engine has been upgraded in this version of ${PRODUCTNAME}. The database engine upgrade introduces an incompatibility with user data for installed extensions for ${PRODUCTNAME} versions prior to 3.2 that may require your action if you downgrade your version of ${PRODUCTNAME}. This version of ${PRODUCTNAME} will convert your extension database to the new Berkeley database format when extensions are installed or removed. After this conversion, the database can no longer be read by earlier versions of ${PRODUCTNAME}. Downgrading to an earlier version may result in a dysfunctional installation. If you downgrade to an earlier version of ${PRODUCTNAME}, you must remove the user data directory {user data}/uno_packages, for example ~/.openoffice.org/3/user/uno_packages, and reinstall all extensions.

I hadn't thought of it as a possible tool for the LibreOffice docs team, but I will keep your words in mind when I start getting properly into Alfresco in the early days of the New Year. Although it doesn't have the workflow development capabilities that could be useful... Like you say, Dropbox is a very simple and practical tool for a small team with good communication and cooperation habits.  Right now, I see Alfresco as something with much more potential, plus it has the plugin for OOo/LibO that allows more-direct integration into the suite. That could give us the ability to develop a sophisticated workflow control while making the contributor's hands-on experience quite simple and transparent.  In any case, I'm looking forward to taking a few chapters of the Writer Guide or developing some chapters of a Calc or Impress guide, so that we can properly see Alfresco in action.

I don't in any way want to be \"control freak\"-ish, and I certainly want to give you the ability to actively contribute to the development of a docs workflow. Maybe you can also help evaluate the possible potential for integration of i18n work, too.  Can I just take this chance to suggest some working rules for us, as regards the Alfresco site?  First of all, let's think of this Alfresco site like this:  I originally had it set-up with the idea that it gives the LibO docs team an opportunity to evaluate Alfresco.  *If* the team likes it and *if* there is serious uptake, there would be two ways to go:  a) We get Florian and Christian to set up an Alfresco installation on the Ooodev De server infrastructure, and we migrate the whole thing over there, with all the developed workflows and all the accumulated docs and data. This would be my preferred solution, but I'm not sure if I will then have OS access via SSH to do any maintenance necessary. That would depend on Florian's and Christian's ideas on the subject.  b) If those guys don't have much time for that, or if they decide they don't want to take on the maintenance of an Alfresco installation, we *could* keep using the current installation at https://documentation.traduction.biz *if* the SC decides that they prefer to assign a libreoffice.org sub-domain instead. In this case, I would re-configure my Apache server accordingly, and we would stay where we are; just the domain name would change: documentation.libreoffice.org, or something like that.  If a) then the current Alfresco install is going to revert to me for my own future professional usage.  If b) then the current Alfresco install is going to be our future working tool.  In either case, we should not think of this Alfresco as an expendable sandbox in which we can do \"quick-and-dirty\" things. ;-) We should *try* not to break anything (although if we do, I can get things fixed very quickly via the paid technical support I have). ;-) And we all need to *RTFM* before attempting things. :-D  This being said, a tool is no good unless you can do things with it, so do go for it.  But let's talk about things on the list beforehand, so that everyone is aware of what's going on, and we can be sure that we're not working at cross-purposes with each other.  While we're developing workflows for the site, and re-configuring things, it would be a really good idea to *document* what we develop, for future reference.  I haven't discussed the idea with Hal yet, but I hope that he's going to act as our \"lead admin\", especially during the next couple of weeks - but even after that, too. He's investing time in learning Alfresco, and his work for LibreOffice is entirely focussed on docs. Plus he's an experienced technical writer. So, if he accepts the idea, he's our anchorman for all Alfresco site admin. In that case, he should be *kept informed* about how the site is developed.  I also suggest that we invite Michael Wheatland and Jean Weber to become site admins.  Michael has ideas for developing possible docs and i18n workflows, and it would be interesting to see how they could maybe work on an Alfresco platform. At the very least, there can be an interesting interaction of ideas.  Jean has said she is taken up with administering her Plone-based web. But I think it would be interesting for her to be able to get a look behind the scenes at Alfresco, for the development of her own project, and maybe to feed back about differences of approach. I see her access as purely \"passive\". The ability to look around, but without actually \"touching\" anything.  By the way, if any Alfresco discussions look like developing into a big conversation of their own, I suggest you just spin-off a new thread, and include \"ALFRESCO\" in the subject line.  What do you think about all this, guys?  David Nelson  "

This note is going to be a bit of a ramble as I write down my thoughts.  Under Company Home there are Spaces (including User Homes, Sites, and Web Projects, among others), and there can be Content Items directly under Company Home. Dumping all the user guide docs into Company Home as Content Items doesn't seem like a good idea, especially if there will be several languages on the site. It seems to me that, at a minimum, we should collect the files into groups (folders, whatever) for specific books.  It looks like one approach might be to create new Spaces, either one for each book, or one for each language with second-level Spaces for each book, or something similar. Since I have Admin access, I don't know if this function is available to others with ordinary user access, but it's probably best done by admins anyway.  Does anyone know enough about this thing to offer some insight, instead of me just blathering away with speculations? I plan to go away and do some reading to try to answer my own questions about how. Or I suppose I could go ahead and create a Space and see what I can do with it.

The site should motivate the visitor to use or at least try LibreOffice and it should motivate people to become an active supporter of the community.  In this sense http://www.libreoffice.org/ is already doing a fairly good job, mostly due to your contribution.   If John Doe then looks at the installation instructions, he might probably be deterred again. It looks terribly complex and difficult. Primarily we should clarify, that installation usually is very, very simple. (By the way, actually a lot easier and faster than MS Office!) For special and specific cases we have of course detailed support articles...   IMO there is no need to edit and keep these support articles in the CMS. The wiki is just the right place.  For example, the german Ubuntu Users Community has best experiences with http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de. Their only place for support articles is the wiki. The wiki has a much lower barrier for potentially contributing authors and thus ubuntuusers.de has a tremendous high number of competent users, who share their knowledge and experience via the wiki.  For installing LibreOffice, average users in the very most cases wont need any instructions at all. Windows users will just do a double-click to start the self-explaining installer, just as they are used to from any other software. Mac users will drag&amp;drop it to the applications folder, just as they are used to from any other software. Most Linux Users will install it from the repository of their distribution, just as they are to from any other software. Some Linux experts may choose another way, but these users are skilled anyway.  There surely remains a little percentage of special cases, where the user needs more information or support for installing. But this little percentage does not justify a prominent place for detailed documentation on the website, that carries the danger and gives the impression that installing LibreOffice is a cumbersome affair.

Alfresco will require a little bit of documentation-reading, but it's a useful expertise to acquire these days, when online team collaborative experience is quickly becoming a wanted skill (IMHO).

I'm putting together a full Getting Started book so Friends of OpenDocument Inc can have a printed copy available for display at their table at the linux.conf.au Open Day at the end of January.  Do you think we should make this book available for sale to the general public (through FoOD's store at Lulu.com), or wait until all the chapters have been updated and declared published? I can easily replace the book's interior PDF with a new one when the officially published book is ready.  While I am working on the book, I am discovering the occasional item that needs to be changed. I don't have time to make the changes as I go, so I'm reporting some of them here on the list, including some that might be considered enhancements rather than corrections. When I've finished with publishing the book, I intend to go back to the chapter files and make the changes, if someone else hasn't already done so.  Why, you might ask, am I not making the changes in the chapter files and using the master document to recompile an up to date book? The full book has two serious problems left over from its incarnation as an OOo book: a selection of buggered-up cross-references, and a bunch of pictures that go missing when the PDF is created. Both problems can be solved after exporting the master document to an ODT, removing the links to the chapter files (thus embedding the contents of those files in the ODF), and deleting (not just hiding) the copyright and TOC pages in the chapter files.  At some point, we (and/or the OOo Docs team) need to do something to clean up these files so they behave themselves, but that will be a major project that we don't have time for right now.  Hal  "

I'm about the closest thing there is to a docs team lead at present, batting for LibO.  I'm interested in working up an internal flow and organization for LibO documentation, and I recently set up an Alfresco server for that at https://documentation.traduction.biz. There are currently about 8 docs team members with accounts there. If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you an account there, too.  There's not much happening on Alfresco yet. This is certainly because it's new and I haven't had time to lead the way and start a tangible work project there yet. I'm busy with other work until the 10th, so it will happen shortly after that.  After that, it depends on whether docs contributors start taking it up as a tool. If they do, then either that Alfresco system will get integrated into the TDF Web infrastructure, or another Alfresco will be set up and there will be a migration of workflow and data.

Major revisions are being deferred until later; at this point we just want to get books ready as quickly as possible.

We could also have different renditions made up to suit different people's needs or interests (for new users; wordprocessing users; calc users; business oriented users; database users etc. )  If we could categorise these and advertise them on our site it may prove to be of help to some.  I will leave a copy of this post on the marketing list and see if anyone would be interested in picking up the idea. I will also make a note of this in the \"ideas\" section of marketing.[2] In this case, I don't think we could call this a promotional idea but more of a tool to the distro.

Click the Browse button and select the file you've been working on. I usually select Documentation and EN for categories and CC, LGPL and MPL for the license. Then click Upload file. You'll see it at the top of the revision list once the upload is complete. :)  When you download a file and edit it, be sure to leave the filename as is.

The Workflow.png flowchart, a document which details our workflow (certainly a working document at this stage of the game - less so as it gets dialed in), A document which details information about the project such as 1) Who is primary stakeholder, 2) Goal of completion, 3) etc... and perhaps another document which gives a list of links to further help such as to the Power User's guide, maybe the irc.freenode.net address...   I'm sure the primary producers of documentation so far have a better idea than I of what would be handy to have instant access to, consolidated in one space, for every work space they could be involved in. The idea is to 1) Make it obvious and easy to someone just joining how they can be of use, and 2) Once the user is underway, keep them from clicking all about looking for different pieces of a puzzle.  And if I'm on the right track here, I wonder when would be a good time to rework http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development to 1) remove our current workflow and matrix, and 2) briefly explain how we use Alfresco, add a link to the site and a request for the user to get in touch with Hal or other to get a sign-in setup.

For those of you who want to help me with screenshots, can we please follow these bases *exactly*, so that we get a uniform set of shots that don't spoil the site design? (I am starting my shot-taking now, and won't be re-doing it again, so this is the way the shots on the site are going to be for the moment.)  I have decided to adopt 1000px by 750px for the window size when taking the shot. (Under Ubuntu, you can easily use \"Screen Ruler\" for accurately sizing the window. The actual graphic shown on the pages will be downsized.)  I am going to use screenshots taken under Ubuntu with the default Ambiance theme (with *no* visual effects activated).  Reminder:  I need some more sample files with which I can produce screenshots for the libreoffice.org, from *all* the LibO apps.  If you have LibO files (from Writer, Calc and Impress) that contain attractively-presented content that is not copyrighted, please mail them to me ASAP.  If you have any well-presented equations for Math, I need some more too.  Similarly, if you have any databases for Base with well-peopled tables, and with forms and reports, I need them, too.  Or, if you feel able to help out by taking screenshots yourself, then:  a) Take them under Ubuntu Linux, using the Ambiance theme, with *no* visual effects.  b) Take the *window only* with the window frame - not the whole desktop.  c) 1000px wide by 750px tall - you can use Screen Ruler to accurately size the window.  e) Anything up to a dozen good shots from each app is what I'm hoping to accumulate.... in each app, demo the key features: in Writer, tables, indexes, etc..... I'm sure you see what I mean....  f) The file you use for taking the screenshot should ideally be called \"sample.odt\" (or whatever extension)  I'll be working on this today Sunday, Jan 9, and tomorrow Monday, Jan 10. I'll be able to use all your contributions that comply with the above and that arrive within these 2 days.  Please mail your contributions directly to me. ;-)  A big thanks for any help. ;-)  P.S. If you're not posting specifically about the work I'm talking about on this thread, please post under another thread and do not go OT here. Thanks for you kind understanding about this.

One thing that I'm not sure of at the moment is the discussion that's going on about doing screenshots under windows. From what they are saying, the screenshots may have to be done under Linux.

So, people are increasingly less likely to need to mess around with tarballs or  anything trickier than a 3 click install.  Many other distros are just waiting  for the proper release of LO.  I had a quick skim through the guide tho  * de-install 'should' be uninstall or un-install  The meaning was fairly clear but it is better as \"Un-\".

A user uploads a new file to the Drafts folder. Someone checks out the file from the Drafts folder to begin editing. The file stays in the Drafts folder and is marked that it is checked out and to show which user is working on it. If possible, prevent other users from editing the file while it is checked out.  Step 2.  The user downloads the file, makes changes and then uploads the file to Alfresco and checks the file back in. The user is then offered the option to either leave the file in the Drafts folder if the file needs further editing or if editing is complete, move the file to the next step in the process, the Review folder.  Step 3.  Another user goes to the Review folder and checks out the file, downloads it and reviews it. If the file was revised, it would be moved back to the Drafts folder and the document is checked back in. If it was ok and ready to proceed to proofing, the file is moved to the Proofing folder and the file is checked in.  Step 4.  A user goes to the Proofing folder, downloads the file and proofs it. If the file needs more work, it is moved back to the Drafts folder. If they agree it is ready for publishing, they go to the Proofing folder and mark that the file is ok. The file is marked as having been proofed once. Then a second user proofs the file and if they agree it is ready to be published, they mark that they have proofed the file and it is ok. Once the file has been proofed by two users, then it will be moved to the Published folder.  I agree about turning on auto-versioning. Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks.  Ron   "

The story was a user phoned tech-support and had trouble with everything they  said.  They finally said \"and now just open the window\" which resulted in  silence from his end, some footsteps and then bird-song.  Also with something too generic (such as windows) there is a danger of  contravening copyright or even just totally confusing people if the word is used  at the beginning of a sentence.   I'm happy with \"dialog\", it's close enough to what i prefer and specific enough  to mean something.

The problem with pop-ups is that there really are so many different kinds and  they do sometimes need to be distinguished between.  I have never heard the terms \"pop-up menu\" or \"pop-up window menu\" and they  sound like things that could appear anywhere and usually done with a normal  mouse click (left button usually).  The only things i have ever seen that could  be referred to in those terms are really called a \"drop-down\" or a \"drop-down  list\".  Its possible that some people use \"drop-down menu\" but again i haven't  heard it.     Although it sounds mad I think it's important to have terms that we don't use in  the glossary so that people can find out what the correct term is.  In this case  the correct term is \"drop-down\" or \"drop-down list\".  While a \"drop-down list\" appears when people use the left-click - the \"context  menu\" (or the older and grammatically incorrect \"contextual menu\") appears with  a right-click.  Since the action to get the menus/lists are quite different the distinction  between the names is quite important.  Also many people are being taught about  computers to quite a high level without ever learning that a right-click menu  exists!  People get amazingly distressed about not knowing when to use a single-click and  when to use a double-click and i have even heard someone bitterly ranting about  a triple-click (for selecting a whole paragraph) as though it makes computers  impossibly difficult to understand and far beyond the capabilities of anyone.     Being VERY clear about which button to click by simply using the correct term in  the correct place is very important to such hopeless people.  @ Sophie.

My basic rationale was that dialog box was more widely used by most of the major software/firmware/hardware developers over the past two decades, including Microsoft, Sun Microsystems--the previous sponsor of OOo, Motorola, Red Hat, IBM, among numerous others.  When working as a technical editor of user guides for (embedded-microcontroller) compilers, assemblers, IDEs, etc. over at the newly branded spinoff of Motorola--Freescale Semiconductor--during 2005, I was directed to follow its corporate style guide, which strictly mandated its use over dialog (no exceptions were allowed, as with many other corporate style guides, such as guides for those firms listed above).  Also, the Wilkipedia has dialog box in lieu of dialog (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_box). The Wiki tends to employ the more accurate nomenclature for most GUI components. If one follows the Wiki forms, then agreement can be more universal. [Hint: If one does not like whatever form the Wiki employs--change (edit) it...] Some editors prefer dialog for one reason or another; others consider the use of dialog to be flawed, lazy, or sloppy usage. Oracle tends to employ both forms...  Another area of disagreement is in the use of \"tabbed page\" or \"tabbed window\" versus a \"tab.\" A tab is the part of the GUI component on a tabbed window/page that a user selects for accessing the desired page/window, much like a small tab on an index card in an older paper-based filing system. The page/window itself contains the bulk of that document's information, but not the small projection (tab).  There are others.   Gary   "

Doing some pro bono (they gave me expensive embedded-microcontroller firmware-development apps to use for free) technical-editing work for Motorola in the very late 1990s/early 2000s, I used each form, depending upon which O/S the particular IDE apps used.  So, another consideration is to employ the term based upon the particular O/S hosting the office suite.   Gary  "

The vocabulary is pretty specific, and people on Mac don't generally refer to Taskbar, Drawer, etc. Ever since OSX came into being, the UI has remained essentially unchanged, so those specific terms are all understood by Mac users.  I agree, however, that completely rewriting the documentation / guides, etc, just to take into account the specificities of Mac vocabulary is not a route that I am going to go down. If Larry wants to make Mac specific guides just for that platform then he is quite welcome to do so as far as I'm concerned :-))   Alex   "

I checked out two documents (Introducing Writer), made minor edits to them, and then checked-in (and so uploaded) new versions of them.  One of them had been in the drafts \"folder\". I approved the checked-in version and it moved to the feedback \"folder\". The other one was already in the publish folder and, when I approved it, it then moved to the \"test FIN\" folder. I could see that Ron Faile has also been working on a document there.  I can see that this is a big, big step forward in relation to our current wiki-based workflow. Plus we have not yet started using the versioning available within Alfresco. There are a lot of other features that would be very valuable to the docs work process, too: the discussion feature, and the advanced workflow features. We have but scratched the surface.  @Jeremy: It would be great if you could make sure that this is visible to everyone.  @Ron: What do you think about this, Ron?  @Samphan: What do you think about this, Samphan? Is this in line with what you envision? Where do we go from here?  @All: It would be great if all you guys can jump in and do test edits on the docs in that space. Remember that these are *not* as yet true working copies that we'll be publishing for our users. They are just test versions as \"dummy content\" for Alfresco testing. So don't feel afraid to experiment and learn with them. (If they are still in usable condition when we have finished testing, then we will use them as drafts when we subsequently get to launch an operational workflow for live work.)  Great work, Jeremy. ;-) I'm still busy on the libreoffice.org site, but I will take time out to start properly RTFM in just a couple of days now.  I'm getting excited about Alfresco.

But, IMHO, when the LibreOffice team has its own dedicated working resources, and when the OOo/LibO disributions start to diverge, and when the LibreOffice team starts work on the manuals that are currently completely unwritten, I'd guess we'll be developing our own documentation independently. I'd guess that this will happen in the fairly near future...  At that time, we'd need some Mac users on the team to get involved and help us provide content that is OK for the Mac community...

I hope you understand the POV and don't feel too mad with me...  David Nelson  "

In particular, they asked me to work up a website contributors team to complete the building of the website and to subsequently maintain it.  I immediately thought of the LibreOffice documentation team, who know LibreOffice well as a product, and who have excellent copy-writing skills.  Could we form a team of 3 to 5 people (for instance, but maybe more) to work on the following tasks:  1) Over the next week to 10 days, I'd like to put finishing touches to the site content. This includes improving the \"Features\" section, and augmenting the \"Get Involved\" and \"About Us\" sections. It will also include a new section on LibreOffice's attractions for home users, SOHO's, NGO and government users, and corporate adopters. I'll also be listening out for your suggestions for improvements.  I want to get this part of the work done quite quickly, because of the upcoming 3.3 release.  2) I'll be liaising with Christian Lohmaier and Christoph Novack to roll out a News section. This will be an opportunity for the website contributors to do some regular journalism and news reporting about and on behalf of the LibreOffice project. This will be done in liaison with Marketing and the SC. I also have some interesting ideas for interviews, publicity and marketing for LibreOffice, and it could be an interesting and enthralling opportunity for some journalistic writing and for imaginative and creative thinking.  3) There will also be some cyclical maintenance and updating work on the website, in connection with LibreOffice releases: updating the New Features page(s), Installation Requirements, etc.  I think this can be interesting work for us, and a great chance to have fun together and work together. Maintaining the written content on libreoffice.org is also a natural center of interest for us, as \"custodians of the English language\" within the project.  I'd love to hear back from you about this. I'm particularly hoping to form a team of regular, recurring contributors, but why not also consider one-off contributions of high-quality work, if some talented writer feels unable to make an on-going commitment?  We're looking for experienced, knowledgeable people willing to contribute properly-finished, good work. I'll be leading this and, although I will obviously be very attentive to your comments and ideas, I will be pushing forward decisions if discussions look like getting bogged down and slowing progress towards expeditious completion. I'm very keen to see our goals getting completed within reasonable times.  Can the project get your expert help?  David Nelson  "

        "text": "I've just finished early implementation Ron's workflow and roughly tested. Here's the procedure of the workflow in Alfresco (sorry for my English -_-!):  Spaces: Drafts, Review, Proofing, Proofing2, Published  Only Alfresco users in the \"Documenters\" group are involved in this workflow. Other users have read-only access to the spaces.  Step 1.     1. A user go to the Drafts space, click \"Add Content\", choose file to    upload, fill-in the document \"Name\", and in the \"Type\" field choose    \"Content\".    2. Someone checks out the file from the Drafts folder to begin editing.       - To check-out a file, click on the \"More Action\" (triangle inside a       circle button) and choose \"Check Out\".       - Then choose the space for the working copy which should be in the       user's home space.    3. The checked-out files stays in the Drafts folder and is marked that it    is checked-out by the \"locked\" icon. Hover at the icon to show which user is    working on it.       - Other users are prevented from editing the file while it is checked       out.  Step 2.     1. The user downloads the working copy, makes changes and then uploads    the file to replace the working copy with new versions.    2. When finish, click the \"Check In\" button of the working copy. The    working copy will be removed and the original file will be editable again.    3. The user is then offered the option to either       - leave the file in the Drafts folder if the file needs further       editing       - or if editing is complete, move the file to the next step in the       process, the Review space, by clicking at the \"More Action\" button and       choose \"Submit to Review\"  Step 3.     1. Another user goes to the Review folder and checks out the file,    downloads it and reviews it.    2. If the file was revised,       - the user check-in the changes       - then choose \"Reject to Drafts\" to move the file to Drafts space.    3.  If it was ok and ready to proceed to proofing       - the user check-in the changes       - then choose \"Submit to Proofing\" to move the file to Proofing space.  Step 4.     1. A user goes to the Proofing space, downloads the file and proofs it.    2. If the file needs more work, it is moved back to the Drafts space by    choosing \"Reject to Drafts\".    3. If the file is OK, it is moved to the Proofing2 by choosing \"Submit to    Proofing2\". This is to mark that the file have been proofed once.    4. Then a second user goes to the Proofing2 space, proofs the file.    5. if the user agree it is ready to be published, s/he choose \"Submit to    Published\" which move the file to Published space. That means the file has    been proofed by two users       "

So, i split that  sub-section into 2 sub-sections; one for Debian and another for Ubuntu.  If  Debian does use sudo then the 2 sub-sections could be recombined.  Later on a  subsection for Debian &amp; Ubuntu does use \"sudo\" for both distros. 4. Is Suse correct?  I thought their name was now openSUSE http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=suse So, i changed all to openSUSE. 5. 1 instance of libreoffice changed to LibreOffice because it was not in a url  or command-line command or other code, just a tpyo i think. 6. Can the source-code tarballs be used in Hurd distros aswell as Linux ones?   Can they be used in BSD OSes?  Is the plural of Linux = Linuxes, Linii, Linices  or distros?  The term 'Distros' may be changing slightly to include other  unix-based platforms. 7. i changed \"dropdown\" to \"drop-down\" 8. Titles shouldn't have  at the end right? 9.  QuickStarter looked fine as it's camel-case and seems to be a name of  something? 10. I changed a title from \"Un-Installing a Previous Version of LibreOffice\" to just \"Un-Installing  LibreOffice\" to make the section more useful.  Added a line to say that  un-installing previous versions is a smart plan. 11. I think \"deselect\" should be changed to \"de-select\" but i left it as it  was.  It was consistent through the document so i guessed it might widely used  in the rest of documentation in which case it is better to stay consistent for a  little niggle like this.  I thought i had proof-read this document before as many of the errors were tiny  issues that i had corrected somewhere before.  These things take a lot less time  2nd time around so i am not worried about that but it does worry me that i might  have followed a wrong work-flow and stuffed something up for someone else?  For  a wiki i should just click on the \"Edit\" tab at the top, do the changes, add a  summary of the changes made and click on \"Save Page\" at the bottom?

        "text": "Hi :)  Drop-down list is the usual form known out there but it is quite generic.   People outside of LibreOffice do shorten it to \"drop-down\" fairly often but  \"drop-down list\" is probably better for formal documentation, especially since  it is already more widely used.  \"Selection list\", \"selection menu\" &amp; \"combo box\" tend to be slightly more  specific and are trying to make it sound more posh and high-class.  All these  terms are  less likely to be understood and \"combo-box\" is definitely tooo geeky  for most people.  However, they are legitimate as specific types of drop-downs  so please lets not change them just to be consistent because that will probably  detract from the perceived quality of our documentation.  I will try to get back to the documentation i edited yesterday to make  \"drop-down\"s into \"drop-down list\"s.

After that, I'll be pulling back a lot from the website, and will be focussing on the LibreOffice documentation project and developing the Alfresco site.  David Nelson  "

For the moment at least, I'd recommend the current wiki page as the place to put final user-ready downloads, ready for links from the libreoffice.org website and direct downloads from the wiki.  At a future time, when the site has rolled over to the new domain, and has gone through a running-in period to troubleshoot any problems, we could *maybe* have Alfresco as even the final drop point, as the ultimate stage in the workflow. But we'd better evaluate that choice at a later date.  In any case, my suggestion would be that the Alfresco site should always house the reference copy of docs, and that we should start uploading all our working content there, for integration into the workflow.

Within the LibreOffice space, there is a space for Writer Guide 3.3, but also spaces for different stages of development, and there's also something named Catalog. Where do we put things? Is Catalog picking up info from elsewhere on the site? (Kind of looks like it.) I know we've been using Alfresco as a sandbox of sorts, so is it still at that stage or has some preferred usage emerged?  Also, can the timeout on logins be changed? I get really irritated having to log on several times a day (and then having to find my way back to wherever I was) because I'm using the site only intermittently.

If you'd like to get involved in working on documentation, you'll be most welcome. If you like, you can have a user account on the Alfresco site, and then you will be able to get involved in the workflow there. Or you can get involved in the development of an l10n workflow.   The SC took a decision at its last meeting to accept the Alfresco site a part of its Web infrastructure, and to put it under a LibreOffice sub-domain (probably alfresco.libreoffice.org).  Most/all active members of the LibreOffice documentation team now have an account there, and a workflow has been developed for the English documentation team.  A few members of the l10n community have already expressed interest in using Alfresco. Probably more will also do so once they become aware of its existence.  Certainly, Alfresco has many technical advantages to offer. See my comments below:  IMHO, the odfauthors.org software is far from being an ideal tool for the LibreOffice docs team.  A) The odfauthors.org software is a product of a past time, when leading-edge systems like Alfresco had not yet reached maturity, that does not have all the features and power of a full-blooded content development system like Alfresco: a mature version control system; powerful and sophisticated workflow management; powerful content search capability able to search within the managed content; built-in discussion system that lets you anchor a discussion on a particular content object; easy updating and uploading of content from directly within the LibreOffice applications, via the Alfresco plugin for OOo/LibO; etc.  B) The odfauthors.org software is a hybrid, one-off, custom application without any community taking its development forward. The odfauthors.org system is a software dead-end, based upon a CMS that is not very widely used, for which little technical support is available except from a small group of developers. Alfresco has an entire community behind it.  C) The odfauthors.org software does not have the capabilities of Alfresco to cater to the LibreOffice project's future needs for a sophisticated product that can integrate closely with the project's other development systems. Alfresco can provide a powerful platform for the production and maintenance of developer documentation: API manuals, etc. The odfauthors.org software cannot compete with it feature-wise: it is a fairly manual system that is now dated.  However, no-one going to be in any way obliged to use Alfresco, just as no-one is going to be obliged to develop LibreOffice documentation on the odfauthors.org site.  I think that you can say that, ultimately, LibreOffice project contributors are going to make their own choice and vote with their feet.  My own personal take on things is this:  I think that odfauthors.org is a great resource for smaller Open Source projects that don't have the people, time or resources to properly develop their own documentation.  In addition, I feel that the LibreOffice project naturally has a common interest with odfauthors.org: the promotion of the ODF format. And, as another Open Source project, notably one that promotes the ODF format, we should be supportive of odfauthors.org.  But I think it's in the best interests of a major software project like LibreOffice to have an in-house documentation team with in-house expertise.  No matter what similarities there might be between OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice right at present (odfauthors.org develops documentation for OpenOffice.org), the two products are quickly going to diverge. LibreOffice might as well start developing its own documentation team and expertise now - especially considering the need, at a future time, to develop comprehensive developer documentation for LibreOffice, in view of rendering it truly open.  Alfresco has many essential features and capabilities for that.   HTH.  David Nelson  "

I understand (and share) David's remarks that Alfresco is a superior system, but I think Italian volunteers would like to maybe try it at a later stage, and for the time being just move to odfauthors.org when oooauthors.org is migrated there.

Several of our members are part of this initiative since a long time and they work on several languages.  - The Alfresco initiative is just born, pushed by David Nelson and has, for the moment and due to his very young age, produced nothing. It aims to work on dedicated LibreOffice documentation on different forms. It his hosted by David Nelson and supported by TDF.  - I'm pushing another initiative dedicated to t9n using xliff file format on Pootle to allow TM and glossaries. This initiative needs to be evaluated and pushed or abandoned following the feedback of the translators.  Even if the ODFAuthors initiative has proven his ability to federate and convey users to our project, this should not prevent other initiatives to take place. Each initiative is welcome if it constitutes an emulation and not a competition et if it contributes at the openness and complementarity of the participations.  Members get the same merit whether they participate to one or another and are respected at the same level. These initiatives are here to provide choices and our contributors will be free to choose the one that better answer their wishes. Other initiatives will take place in the future and they will be welcomed and evaluated in the same way.  I hope this is clear for every body and I will add an introduction of the different initiatives on the welcome documentation page of the wiki.  Kind regard Sophie "

My opinion FWIW is that Base related stuff is desperately needed, including a full Base Guide. We've been rebranding the OOo user guides as an initial set for LibreOffice, but the Base Guide has never been written. Three draft chapters (badly in need of editing) exist, but that's all. One could build on that, and the Base Gyude outline, or start from scratch. Of course, other Base-related materials would be useful, too. IMO the \"Getting Started with Base\" chapter is quite good, so we wouldn't want to duplicate that.  I personally don't have much database experience beyond the trivial, but I'm good at testing, critiquing, and editing, revising... if only we can find some database people to write an initial draft!

It claims to be a  German \"polished\" translation of issue 28136 [2].  As my impression of the doc team here around is rather good ;) I just  want to suggest you to think also of a tutorial-like Guide. Lerning by  doing is Not Bad(TM).   Of course, the tutorial only covers a very little section of the Base  functionality but it enables the reader to work with Base better than  any other doc I found.   So the first idea could be to extend this tutorial (e.g. how n:m  relations are handled in queries, forms and reports).   Another idea might be to add some background chapters about database  theory, but there are plenty of them around so this does not really  seem necessary.   Of course, only if you want to take this little tutorial as starting  point - it's just a suggestion.

This can be confusing for the unaware, as the only indication that anything is happening is that an icon starts jumping up and down in the dock, which is not the first place one would necessarily look.  As this behaviour is caused by an error in the AppleScript used for installation of the LangPack, I have also filed a bug and included a corrected script which does bring the installation window to the foreground. However, this correction will only be included in future releases of LibreOffice, as I doubt that the Langpacks will be rebuilt in-between.   Alex   "

If you are not confident or feel slightly too unsure, or if you don't have  publishing rights yet then just use \"Save\" but let this list know the page is  nearly ready.  \"Save\" seems a good way of doing small or partial updates and getting them up on  the site for other editors/reviewers to see.

And perhaps there are ways to automate (or semi-automate) more of the changes, using macros or table autoformats or something, which I haven't spent time figuring out.  We could discuss whether to spend the time on those items when working on the first version of the other books, but OTOH debating stuff takes time that could be spent getting real work done.

I think the Getting Started guide chapters are well enough along to  be considered almost final for a first release. They just need to be reviewed by  someone before being considered final for 3.3. If we remove the Writer Guide  files, what are the users going to read if they need some documentation?  Especially since 3.3 was just released and many people will be visiting the  site. They need to be able to download something, even if it's not finished. The  wiki is a working space as well, in every area of the project.  I also thought that the documentation development page for working files should  not have been deleted so quickly. Alfresco is only in it's infantcy as far as  implementation goes. It would have been nice to have kept it until things are  more ironed out.  Just my opinion though. Ron  "

That way, all content would be consistent, with no \"mini-revolutions\" in a small subset of pages. 90% of the rest of the site content was provided by myself, and I proofread/edited the rest, so my *suggestion* would be to do the \"Why?\" pages on similar lines.  At a later date, we'll be re-visiting the page layouts with the involvement of our Design team. At that time, we can spruce the page presentations up a lot.  However, if you have new ideas about style and layouts, please do tell us about them, so that we can take a look at them all together, because fresh input is always welcome.  In any case, like Frank Sinatra sang, just do it your way, and then we can take a look all together after.  And a big thanks for your help! :-)  David Nelson  "

We're going to have to look into the question of setting-up an RSS feed from Alfresco (and maybe a status page akin to what you have with Pootle), so that work information is easily accessible outside the site or without logging in.

Alfresco has now to be given a chance to prove being better than ODFAuthors and has to convince them.

I have seen no pressure from anyone here to use Alfresco, I don't feel under pressure to do so, I will try it because I want to.

As far as I could tell, the \"various\" folder was removed, so I removed the relevant paragraph (\"Various is a space which holds files of note that are not under the structure of our workflow. It contains files of different type and use, and is worth poking around to see what is available to you. However, we are currently more concerned with the catalog space. That is where all LibreOffice documentation resides.\")  A few things still need to be done before it can advance. It needs updated screenshots to reflect the new hierarchy. There's probably general stuff I've missed than can still be improved. One significant thing that could be worked on is consistency when referring to the reader. The guide often switches between first-person and second-person, and I think it would be better to stick to one. For example, on page 13, it says, \"we have successfully added our first content,\" but in much of the beginning the reader is referred to as \"you.\" It switches back and forth between \"you\" and \"we\" (sometimes in the same paragraph), which is inconsistent and less smooth. Some of this seems intentional, but I think it's an area that can definitely be improved upon. The index is still empty, but I wonder if an index is even necessary  with text search, its seems sort of redundant. I also didn't implement the changes in the discussions. If someone wants to work on these, perhaps this document can then be moved to review.  A lot of this it trivial, so perhaps it's not worth dedicating a lot of time to; on the other hand, it's the way all documenters will be introduced, and it's a great place for a new documenter to start working (this is the first significant contribution I've made).

I read some mails stating that all ODFAuthor documents should be integrated into alfresco as soon as possible.  And some answers given to the French NL-team seemed me the same problem.   this was kind of solution I looked for.  Every document (final version) should be on both systems as Jean and Andreas mentioned.   And as a great ease it would be, if there were a list of all existing documents.

If a chapter is \"published\" (in other words, final) then you don't even need an account on the website. You can just go there and download it.  If such a setting would be possible in Alfresco as well, then we don't need to copy the files into the wiki and from there to ODFAuthors.

There is, by default, a \"Guest home\", where all the content being processed on the site is available for viewing and downloading, which is the way it should be. Jeremy's also been working on a view to provide information about work currently being done on the site, which can be integrated into the guest space.  Somewhere during the development work, the site has been configured to redirect unlogged users to the login page, rather than sending them to the guest home. This is something that will have to be adjusted back to the default setting.  As I mentioned before, it would be good to have an RSS feed from the Alfresco site, so that people can stay informed about work in progress without even having to visit the guest home.  Personally, I don't see interfacing with the ODFAuthors project as a *high* priority. It's an independent project, and Jean Weber is already doing liaison. To me, that seems like a perfectly good solution right now.  Plus, what Karl-Heinz is proposing could be quite complex and demanding to implement, and would take a lot of time away from more-important priorities: focussing on workflow and actually producing urgently-needed documentation.  I guess this answers the original topic in the thread, so \"HTH\". ;-)  David Nelson  "

Actually, it should have a character style assigned.    * Similarly, in the Writer guide under \"Finding and replacing text\", names of UI elements are variously unmarked, italic, or bolded.  Which should it be, under what conditions? I consistently made sure they were bolded, or occasionally names of fields or tabs in italic.  But, should buttons be bold and fields be italic?  That is, the rules need to be nailed down.  And, rather than just ad-hoc bolding, there should be a char style defined for that.  * I also note that the '' character used in menu paths, set in \"Liberation Mono\" and bold, does not look good at all.  The arrow head is too small, and it has thinner strokes than the text it is separating.  * We should share a project-specific dictionary with words like 'autocorrection' and 'autotext'.  Having a dictionary, rather than just ignoring the wavies, will help ensure consistant terminology and spelling.  * I see the phrase \"time-varying data\" where the hyphen is shaded as if a field.  But It's not telling me what this shading means.  No tool-tip or interesting information when I right click.  How do I find that?  * Note that choosing \"default formatting\" for a selection via the context menu does not save a Formatting change note!  Somehow a whole bunch of copies of the word \"options\" were in a funny font.  "

OK the big difference is that Nabble maintains a separate archive and has it's own members database - so if you want to post via the Nabble archive you must have an account in the TDF specific nabble database. You must also be subscribed to the mailing list.  Here is the way it works in practice - the Nabble archive right now 'sees' 80+ Mailing lists for TDF, once a person registers with the TDF/Nabble archive then from within the Nabble interface they can go to a TDF/List and have Nabble handle the list registration - you can, from within the Nabble interface opt to receive mails to your personal in-box, but the default it to not do so.   If you registered to a TDF mail list in a 'normal' way, meaning outside of the Nabble interface, then you sill must register with the Nabble database (tdf specific db) before it will post a message to the any list for you - which is a good thing, so no anonymous posting.  Let's look at that again - I registered with a TDF mail list, from my mail client, I go to Nabble and say post this to that list - it says I don't know you, so you register with Nabble and then go to the list and try to post - Nabble will say: You must be registered with the list and you just say - go to hell and post it..it works, because once nabble knows who you are it will do what you ask.  Now you are not registered to a ML from you mail client. You go to Nabble, try to post, are prompted to register, you do so, now you want to post to a list and Nabble again tells you that you must _still_ register with the list (because Nabble does not own the lists) and you say OK - nabble will generate an email to register your email address (the one your registered with Nabble) to the mailing list with the noreply flag, you will get a confirmation in your mail client in-box and you must reply to that just as if you had registered yourself.  Now - one advantage here is that you never need to unregister. This is really good for those cases where someone wants to ask 1 or 2 questions and then doesn't want to see the list anymore. or, a likely scenario, they ask 1 or 2 questions every year or so, this is a common scenario and again this never needing to unregister (therefore not needing to re-register) is handy.  That 1 or 2 question person by the way (and yes I already ran the numbers for LIbO, just like I did at OO.o) makes up the overwhelming majority of list users (and not just on the users list).  To wrap it up - for the OP here, just register with Nabble, for on-going purposes, I wrote this long email as a first draft for a wiki page...will put a link here when it is done.  Thanks  Drew   "

I left change tracking on, so you can see what I proposed.  * It already mentions that names of books and such should use the Emphasized style.  Although I recall from grade school treating the names of books and the names of stories differently, I suppose for simplicity we can have just one.  But, how would we hyperlink/cross reference the name of a different chapter, or worse yet, the name of a section within a different chapter?  * The OTT file already notes that there are styles for Menu Paths and certain UI elements.  I saw that they were not always used, and in fact did not notice such a style at first.  The template admonishes against ever using Bold and Italic or other changes directly.    It states that names of dialog boxes are in plain text.  I changed that to refer to a new LibOUiItem style, which I defined to look exactly like the existing OooMenuPath style.  Also, use the same treatment on all elements uniformly; buttons are not different from field labels, etc.  As for the appearance of the menu path separators, I made a User Field for that.  Apparently, as far as I can tell, I can insert text but not associated complex formatting.  Is there a fancier mechanism available?  So, you need to use the field to insert whatever character and spacing is used, and also apply a character format to just that part.  And, the whole of the substitution needs to work with a single style.  At least, once that is done, you can change the arrow character, it spacing, and its style globally and it changes everywhere.  Related question:  does the template changer add-in pull in \"User Fields\"?  Do they normally replicate in the manner of a style change when you open the document again?  * What fonts are used?  What fonts can/should we use?  I noticed another stray bit of formatting in the OTT file:  one word was in Bitstream Vera Serif.  And in the chapter I looked at initially, the contents of a table is DejaVu Serif and the table headers in DejaVu Sans.  Looking closely now, that is not the definition of the styles, so it was applied directly.  Is there a tool to show what fonts are being used in the document?  It would help identify stray formatting. Likewise, is there a way to identify or search for any ad-hoc formatting, as opposed to text that only gets its attributes from named styles?  "

It is totally integrated with the sister site, and would theoretically be the final publishing platform for user-ready content - the last stop in the workflow, so to speak.

At the moment, share.traduction.biz is accessible by log-in only (use your usual log-in credentials), because there's a lot of configuration work to be done, but the plan is to make it accessible to the world without having to log-in, once it's ready for prime time.

My 2 cents about things would be this:  1) One of the first things I'd like personally to see done would be to rename the OOo styles as LibO styles. I can't think of any reason for *not* doing this. Can anyone else think of any issues that would arise?  2) As regards the menu item separator, I'd opt for simplicity and just use \">\". Using a field feels like an unnecessary complication to me, and I'm not so fond of the arrow in LiberationMono. I'd add a sentence to make this a convention.  3) There no clear conventions in the template about how to express keystrokes and keystroke sequences. My suggestion would be that we should add explanations about this. Again, I'd keep things simple and use \"<>\" to enclose all keystrokes, and I would't bother with special characters from WingDings, etc (for the Mac  key, for instance). So we'd have:  , , , , , ,  +   etc.  However, it's true that the LibreOffice software itself doesn't do this. So what are people's thoughts on that?  David Nelson  "

If the existing file name prefixes fit the bill, we would have \"0202WG3\".  The version would be taken from the Alfresco version, and is not recorded in the file on every edit.  We can put the target language in meta-data too if we want it to show up in tool tips or whatever.  Language is a suggested value for User Properties; use the same two-letter code as we are in the Alfresco directories.  So, a translation might include an introductory passage that states, \"Based on document 0202WG3-en-2.2, with some unique material ported directly from the zh-ch-2.7 that has not found its way back to en yet.  Mostly synchronized with en-2.9.\"  As you see, several documents might be referred to with ad-hoc classifications as to what the relationship is, so I would not include such details in meta-data.  However, the author might set up alert dependencies with the various other versions to be apprised when they are updated "

What would be the advantage of manually maintaining a wiki page?  AFAIK, all the people currently actively working on English LibreOffice documentation *seem* to be taking up Alfresco.  There would actually be advantages for other NL teams to do so as well, if they want to take a translation-based approach to producing documentation for their community - or even if they want to produce their own content.

        "text": "Putting the revision number in the document has problems.  Notice that git, for example, doesn't have classic file revision numbers like SVN.  Simple numbers need to be dished out by an authority, rather than just incremented each time the file is saved.  After all, different people can each save the file.  The versioning, whatever it is, needs to be tied with the versioning =system=.  In the case of files stored on Alfresco, that's Alfresco's version number.  When you refer to some revision, it's not just \"some copy I got from so-and-so via some passing around\", but some place you can go and get a \"committed\" version from.  Furthermore, you have some weak ordering so you know if an available version is newer than the one you were using before.  For files that are not gotten from Alfresco, wherever you got them from needs some versioning system.  So, I stick by my analysis, but amend it to decorate the version number with the authority that produced that number.  As a community, we can have a (very small) registration of codes and their repositories, along with a description of each.   So, you might refer to document 0202WG3-[AF]2.2-en, where [AF] refers to this group's existing Alfresco system, and the component could be omitted when it is not necessary.  0202WG3-2.2 omits two components, for example.  We also need to ensure that document numbers are assigned uniquely.  A systematic approach with wildcards can be used to register a whole book of many files, and this list is kept to ensure that new ids are assigned uniquely when someone wants one, but they are still short and reasonably mnemonic. Perhaps we want to flip it around from the current file names so the wild part is always a suffix:  WG3* is \"Writer's Guide for major version 3\" with the per-book note on how chapter numbers are filled to two digits and suffixed to that.  So we need, perhaps on a Wiki page, two lists:  The unique id base part assignment, and the versioning authority information.  "

        "text": "Hi, :-)  My *personal* view of the basic principles of a versioning system for English documentation would be this:  1) The versioning system should be totally independent of Alfresco's versioning, and should be maintained manually by the English docs team, and based on the status of a document as considerered by the working contributors. That way, the system is properly portable to any working environment.  2) The reference version of English documentation should be stored on the English docs team's working environment - Alfresco, or whatever other system the team chooses to use.  3) The document's meta data seems to me to be the logical place to store the versioning info. You get genuine portability and are not tied to any particular working environment. Plus, you're not tied to carefully preserving OS file names in order to preserve the versioning information.  4) The principles and rules of the versioning system should be explained on the wiki, but the English docs team should non be tied to maintaining records of versions on the wiki. All that could be done in an automated manner via Alfresco, and made publically consultable on a login-free web page.  5) We should try and devise a system that is as easy to understand and apply as possible - especially by people without a degree in mathematics. :-D  That would be my own 2 cents.

I think that  a simple disclaimer as Barbara has been doing is the best work-around.  I guess  it might be good to use an icon set that is not the default for OOo.  However, i  think OOo icons are copy-left'ed rather than copyrighted so it is not the same  as the issue about screen-shots in Windows.  So, while getting the icons sets 'right' is a level of perfection that would be  nice i think that it is unattainable and not really necessary.     One work-around is to get creative and deliberately use a different icon set for  each screen-shot on a page.  The disclaimer should have a clickable link to the  page about how to change the icon set and/or a page with examples of several  different icon sets and/or the design teams page about icon sets.  This would  neatly cover any discrepancies and turn them into a bonus rather than a problem.  Normal policy of aiming at consistency should be followed unless we agree to  deliberately 'get creative'.

Just as a reminder to all :  The reason is simple : Microsoft basically says no \"UI elements, icons or other bits of our copyright protected OS\" in documentation under an open source licence, that is then likely to be sold / commercialised, unless they, i.e. Microsoft, give you permission to do so.  1) MS were apparently contacted in the past (by Florian from what I have read, but I have no actual confirmation of that) about giving their permission to such use in the German OOo community documentation effort, and no positive reply was forthcoming. Remember that at the time, Sun had also signed a mutual agreement with Microsoft to settle all IP-related litigation, but the agreement was not a blanket free-for-all get off the hook. Indeed, most of the details of the agreement never came out, and I'd place no bets on MS having allowed the community \"free electron\" aspect of OOo any leeway whatsoever, contrary to whatever Sun might have gained for StarOffice, its proprietary product offering.  2) The current authoring / documentation community may wish to throw caution to the wind, but it is my understanding that TDF would not particularly relish the thought of being accused of any sort of infringement by MS, or even giving them the chance to do so. MS have had a fairly broad communication strategy of indicating when they felt others, particularly the free software community, infringed on their IP rights in one way or another. Getting market penetration is one thing - doing so at the risk of being accused of infringement is not the way to gain the support of a more widespread public, especially those in executive IT functions, who will have their own legal departments breathing down their necks.  All it takes is one press release from an antagonistic player. It doesn't matter whether MS, or anyone else for that matter, is right or wrong, what matters is the effect it will have on the project as a whole.  Oh, and just because OOoAuthors / ODFAuthors was unaware of this, or chose to ignore it in the past is no excuse. They (as in the \"organisation\") should be equally aware of the problem, but the risks they take are their own.   Alex   "

In one place it was more noticeable in the user was directed to \"select\" something in the dialog.  In that case, the terminology is clearly wrong.  Selecting is not the same as operating on the widget.  Selecting directs the attention to it, and another operation may then be performed, such as toggling a check box.  I suppose in some context where the option itself is referred to in an imperative sense, saying the option is selected is OK and in fact I didn't notice initially.  But you'd have to be careful about the wording of the sentence: are you being imperative or directing the user's action?  It's more consistent and easier to just use a word that always works.  To that end, I'm changing whatever descriptive phrase was used to \"enabled\" (antonym: \"disabled\").  That works for any type of control (check box, radio box, combo-box).  I'm also trying to be more careful about wording things to reflect the desired state, rather than the action.  I.e. clicking on an option doesn't necessarily enable it:  it will toggle it, and you shouldn't click on it unless it was off before.  So don't (just) direct the user to click on something to achieve an effect.  Rather, the effect occurs when the option is enabled.  And of course this is the very case in which merely selecting it doesn't do anything other than make the gui draw a selection rectangle around that item. "

So, for a lot of office users the words might be uncomfortable.   Select and de-select are safe even if i do still shudder a bit when de-select is  used.  Generally it is better to stick with a word that is used a lot in documentation  even if it is blatantly wrong or used badly but consistently.

The race for funds is open until March 21st 2011, which marks the beginning of Spring in the northern hemisphere. All users - especially enterprises - are invited to donate to the capital stock of the future foundation.  \"After thorough investigation, the Steering Committee came to the conclusion that a foundation based in Germany would provide the best stability, not only for our users, but also for adopters, developers and enterprises. For achieving this stability, a capital stock of at least 50,000 Euros is considered best practice in Germany,\" says Florian Effenberger, Steering Committee member of The Document Foundation. \"Now that we have our first release of LibreOffice, which has been downloaded and installed all around the world, the time has come to legally establish the future home for our community\".  All donations will be used for setting-up The Document Foundation, and after the fifty thousand Euros has been collected for the capital stock, donations over the top of that sum will be fed directly into the future foundation's budget to cover operating costs. Should the race for funds not succeed, The Document Foundation will use the donations to incorporate itself in a different country that requires less capital stock, such as the United Kingdom.  To achieve their ambitious goal of a Foundation in Germany in just five weeks, the community has set-up a dedicated website with detailed information at http://challenge.documentfoundation.org The site will also give adopters, community members and corporate sponsors a voice, and will have special features rolled out at the accomplishment of each donation milestone.  \"We have seen wide support from many organizations, and the amount of volunteer work that has been put into The Document Foundation is just amazing. Without people donating their free time, knowledge and creativity to what will be the future home of LibreOffice, we wouldn't be where we are today. However, volunteer work alone can't fund the necessary capital stock, which is why we have started a public race for donations, especially targeting contributions from enterprises and public administrations adopting LibreOffice, and those interested in an independent, vital and growing ecosystem around free office productivity software\", Florian Effenberger adds.  Information about LibreOffice can be found at http://www.libreoffice.org The home of The Document Foundation is at http://www.documentfoundation.org  About The Document Foundation The Document Foundation has the mission of facilitating the evolution of the OOo Community into a new, open, independent, and meritocratic organization within the next few months. An independent Foundation is a better reflection of the values of our contributors, users and supporters, and will enable a more effective, efficient and transparent community. TDF will protect past investments by building on the achievements of the first decade, will encourage wide participation within the community, and will co-ordinate activity across the community.

So, should we then standardize our use of \"Euro\" to this for all documentation, website and marketing materials?  There was also a discussion, with no decision about the treatment of the word \"Euro\". Would we write: 50 000 euro or 50 000 Euro or should we rather write Euro 50 000 or euro 50 000  or EU50 000 ?  2. The setting of the the thousand separator and the decimal point. There seems to be multiple acceptable usages. For example all of the following seem to be correct:  50 000.05 50,000.05 50.000,05 50 000.05 50.000,05  Is there an already \"agreed to\" use of the thousand separator and decimal point for the LibreOffice documentation team?

I think if we were to settle on a standard \"LibreOffice international style\" then we could develop material that would not have to be re-edited. Would we then use the \"50,000.05 euro\" in France or would it be \"50 000,05\" euro?  Would it not make sense to standardise to a style that would be applied to all three groups: documentation, website and marketing?

This has always been the way, and I don't know of any translator who does it any other way.  If the documentation is in English, then let the English presentation preside, ie, a comma for the thousands separator, and a dot/fullstop for the decimals - as for space as a thousands separator, personally, I'm not a fan, but that's just MHO.  As for Euro, the shortened form I see the most often is the standardised banking form, i.e. EUR, much like GBP, USD, AUD, CDN, etc.  If I have to translate something from English to French I will correct the presentation accordingly for that target and vice-versa.

We'd be continuing to work on it, and you'd have an out-of-date copy. It would be particularly sad since we are about to re-do *all* the screenshots in the docs. They're currently mostly taken under Windows. The plan is to re-take all the screenshots under Ubuntu 10.10. And that's just one of the tasks scheduled.  We'd love to keep you with us, Johnny. It seems like a sad duplication of effort for you to be documenting LibreOffice \"over there\" while we're doing the same thing \"over here\". :-D  When you wrote to me asking me where to start, I mentioned that the best thing would be to write to Hal and Barbara on the list, because they are the people with the closest view of the work right now.  Me, I've been busy dealing with Alfresco, plus I've also had client work to do that has meant that I've not actually been doing any documenting recently.  To make up for that, I had volunteered to re-take all those screenshots. But, for instance, this could be one task you could help out with, Johnny.  Hal, Barbara, can you guys organize Johnny and me and point us both at some work, given that you know best where we are with things right now?  By the way, we already have a couple of meta tasks we need to get done:  1) We need to finalize a LibreOffice versioning system to maintain in the meta info of each file we work on.  2) We need to finalize the chapter template.

In case anybody might want to use OOo/LibreOffice in such a  manner, check out that forum topic: http://technicaleditor.livernoisyard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=31 http://technicaleditor.livernoisyard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=31>.  In a nutshell, the project updates published OOo ODFAuthors 3.3 ODT files, ports the \"final\" edited source files into Adobe FrameMaker via the ODT subdocument files that were first converted into DOC files. FrameMaker then reconfigures the book's layout to the desired page format and takes advantage of better typesetting algorithms that DTP apps use, but that fancy word processors like Word or OOo/LibO do not. Also, FrameMaker can do external cross references (xrefs) very reliably, has a dependable master-document (a book, in FrameMakerese...) capability, plus having real run-in subheads--three areas that OOo/LibO, plus Word, do not do well, if at all.  FrameMaker can port (distill in FrameMaker talk) a PostScript (PS) file with the Adobe PDF printer file to use with Acrobe Acrobat Professional for generating the actual PDF, along with bookmarks and numerous specialized output options. Acrobat can then enable the resulting PDF file for anybody using the ubiquitous Adobe Reader application to do markup and comments directly on the PDF--to send back to the prepress editors.  In case anybody might want to do something like this in their organization, e.g., using OOo/LibO for the easier, less-specialized authoring and copyediting tasks and employ real DTP for the higher functions, ask away if you have any questions--either via the email messages or via my forum, or both. I have done these for some time now and never seem to have any real problems migrating the ODT/DOC files into FrameMaker.

In just eight days, some 2,000 donors from all over the world contributed 50,000 for the capital stock necessary to set-up the legal entity in Germany.  \"We still can't believe it,\" says Florian Effenberger, Steering Committee member. \"It happened in such a short period of time and was beyond our wildest expectations. You all really rock! On behalf of the Community, the Steering Committee would like to thank all the donors for their generous support.\"  The 50,000 collected will form the Foundation's paid-up capital, ensuring a permanent future for the organization after the legal paperwork is complete, based in Germany. The capital will be frozen assets for the Foundation: the funds cannot be spent, and we will be able to avail just the annual interest. All money donated from now on will actually bankroll our ongoing running costs for things such as marketing, hardware, infrastructure, attending trade shows, initial financing of merchandising material and, of course, developing new and exciting ideas.  \"So we still need your support: Every donation helps to pay for our future operational running,\" Effenberger adds.

An independent foundation is a better reflection of the values of our contributors, users and supporters, and will enable a more effective, efficient and transparent community. TDF will protect past investments by building on the achievements of the first decade, will encourage wide participation within the community, and will co-ordinate activity across the community.

First, the bad news. After having done some particularly-inspired configuration work on Alfresco, it came crashing to a halt and died. This was the admin's human error, not Alfresco's.  All attempts to fix the problem over the past few days have been fruitless to date. If anyone is curious and wants to download a backup of the crashed site, you can get it at [1] - a juicy 759 Mb. It contains everything from the system: database, file system, the currently-inaccessible data, etc.  There is a completely new and working Alfresco installation on http://alfresco.libreoffice.org and http://documentation.libreoffice.org, but all user accounts are going to be have to be recreated.. I will do this as from Friday.  After that, I'll start rebuilding everything. But I currently have no assurance of being to recover *any* data.  Oh, did I mention good news? Again, I should point out that this was 100% human error and no malfunction of Alfresco's. Alfresco has proven so far to be extremely stable and reliable on the server, and the performances are now quite reasonable. This disaster happened in the same way that a perfectly-working car will drive into a wall if you point it in that direction.  Now that the domain names have rolled over to the libreoffice.org domain, I'm planning to contact the Alfresco project and try and get them involved as a partner in configuring and customizing the site.  For the next 24-48 hours, I'm busy and won't be heard much, but I'll be working on things over the weekend.  You can imagine how humbly I offer you all my apologies.

Some of those, AFAIK, have not been worked on since I put them there; and the Getting Started chapters are on the wiki and, again AFAIK, have not been modified on Alfresco. If I don't have everything, others might; in particular, whoever last edited a chapter might have a copy on their computer. So if you're unable to recover them from backup, we can probably replace them without too much drama after the folder hierarchy is rebuilt and our user accounts are recreated.  This might be a good time to consider keeping a backup set of the working files on the ODFAuthors site and/or the LibreOffice wiki as well, although ensuring those are the latest files would be extra work that might get overlooked.  --Jean   "

Hindsight is wonderful but presumably the back-ups  fell foul of the same problem as the original as does sometimes happen.  See the  new Enterprise where Commander Tucker is unhappy to only have only 1 backup for  a 5 part system that can run on just 1 cylinder (in a pinch).  I imagine David  has been \"sweating buckets\" trying to recover or rebuild and most people have  probably been pitying him while trying to find their own back-ups to help him.

I believe the ones with no letter are the most recent versions of the docs, however there are no guarantees and the only way to verify would be to have the most recent documenter vet the file.

A quick read of the four common guides for producing user guides demonstrated that they might not be up-to-date nor have ever been substantive- or copy-edited. So, I edited one of them over the past weekend. I consider it a rapidly done one-pass work-in-process, and none of the edit changes were accepted, so its edit tracking is available in its entirety.  Some exposition of what I am doing and how it relates to the ODFAuthors guides can be viewed on the forum site that I am employing to construct an OOo to Adobe FrameMaker/Acrobat Professional tutorial (http://technicaleditor.livernoisyard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=51&amp;p=36#p36 http://technicaleditor.livernoisyard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=51&amp;p=36#p36>).

The edited document is expressed in ODT, DOC, and a couple of PDF files. The PDF files were enabled by Acrobat Professional for performing Commenting and Analysis with Adobe Reader, in case anybody would like to practice using that Adobe reviewing feature. A simple Reader application is all that is needed. I encourage my author clients to use that feature, in addition to others, for all our book-layout projects, as it saves us both time and effort for making a small number of edits and such.  In case anybody wants to comment or add to the ODT edit tracking for this document, knock yourself out--either via the authors list, the forum site, or both. However, if you were to submit an entire file instead of itemizing the edits, do so via an attachment on the forum site instead of through this authors list.  I also addressed LibreOffice for this message because of the strong likelihood that they might still be relying on OOoAuthors source material for the bulk of their own documentation.   Gary "

BTW, the OOoAuthors accounts are posted here: http://www.friendsofopendocument.com/newsite/?page_id=194  I usually update the accounts every six months, but I haven't done the July-Dec 2010 set yet. Money from \"GS with LO\" sales doesn't appear until January 2011.  --Jean * To support the work of community volunteers in promoting, improving and providing user assistance for the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) and open source software designed to operate on data in this format.

We already have a multi lingual wiki for our documentation, it will be even better when we will have migrated it to language subdomains.

        "text": "On September 28th, 2010, The Document Foundation was announced. The last six months, it feels, have just passed within a short glimpse of time. Not only did we release three LibreOffice versions within three months, have created the LibreOffice-Box DVD image, and brought LibreOffice Portable on its way. We also have announced the LibreOffice Conference for October 2011 and have taken part in lots of events worldwide, with FOSDEM and CeBIT being the most prominent ones.  People follow us at Twitter, Identi.ca, XING, LinkedIn and a Facebook group and fan page, they discuss on our mailing lists with more than 6.000 subscriptions, collaborate in our wiki, get insight on our daily work in our blog, and post and blog themselves. From the very first day, openness, transparency and meritocracy have been shaping the framework we want to work in. Our discussions and decisions take place on a public mailing list, and regularly, we hold phone conferences for the Steering Committee and for the marketing teams, where everyone is invited to join. Our ideas and visions have made their way into our Next Decade Manifesto.  We have joined the Open Invention Network as well as the OpenDoc Society, and just last week have become an SPI-associated project, and we see a wide range of support from all over the world. Not only do Novell and Red Hat support our efforts with developers, but just recently, Canonical, creators of Ubuntu, joined as well. All major Linux distributions deliver LibreOffice with their operating systems, and more follow every day.  One of the most stunning contributions, that still leaves us speechless, is the support that we receive from the community. When we asked for 50,000  capital stock for a German-based foundation, the community showed their support, appreciation and their power, and not only donated it in just eight days, but up to now has supported us with close to 100,000 ! Another one is that driven by our open, vendor neutral approach, combined with our easy hacks, we have included code contributions from over 150 entirely new developers to the project, alongside localisations from over 50 localizers. The community has developed itself better than we could ever dream of, and first meetings like the projects weekend or the QA meeting of the Germanophone group are already being organized.  What we have seen now is just the beginning of something very big. The Document Foundation has a vision, and the creation of the foundation in Germany is about to happen soon. LibreOffice has been downloaded over 350,000 times within the first week, and we just counted more than 1,3 million downloads just from our download system  not counting packages directly delivered by Linux distributors, other download sites or DVDs included in magazines and newspapers  supported by 65 mirrors from all over the world, and millions already use and contribute to it worldwide. With our participation in the Google Summer of Code, we will engage more students and young developers to be part of our community. Our improved release schedule will ensure that new features and improvements will make their way to end-users soon, and for testers, we even provide daily builds.  We are so excited by what has been achieved over the last six months, and we are immensely grateful to all those who have supported the project in whatever ways they can. It is an honour to be working with you, to be part of one united community! The future as we are shaping it has just begun, and it will be bright and excellent.  "

My impression is that there is a choice of ways of working in Documentation and  that updated documents are copied into the various places.  As a result we have  experts in the ways the OOo people work and our experts interface well with  people that have developed significantly better ways with the new systems.   Hopefully this means we can help people move to the new methods at their own  pace.     I'm not sure that we need leadership but we do need confidence.  Self  confidence.  Often people only get that from strong leadership.  Guidance from  people like Hal on how her work-flow works would help .

NOT the Getting Started guide, which was done so early that it may not have the latest rebranding features. http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation OR http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation/  If you'd like to do further reviews on the Calc Guide, and if you happen to use Windows, some chapters need some items checked specifically on Windows because they may be different from Linux or they are Windows only.

A question to you, the members of the LibreOffice Docs team (and other interested people): in the hypothetical situation that I stick up my hand for the Docs team leader role, would you consider me suitable?  Some of you know my style from OOo. I'm a pragmatist: while I'd love to have us maintain a workflow that includes good reviews (both technical and editorial), I think it's more important to get information out there as quickly as possible in a form that's suitable for the general audience. In other words, if enough people are not available to do reviews quickly, then I tend to publish early and clean up any errors later. Similarly, I prefer to have no info on a topic than hold up publication until the info can be obtained and verified; missing info can be added as it becomes available.  I'm also 100% in favour of maintaining the source docs for the user guides in ODT format, which enables us to publish them in numerous formats relatively quickly and easily. This is what we're doing now. (An additional benefit is that using ODT files enables people to work on the user guides without needing to have Internet access while doing the work.) And lastly, writing documentation for an office suite using any method other than the office suite itself strikes me as a very bad advertisement for one's product.  Hoping to hear from you on my question in the second paragraph.  --Jean   "

However, I get mail notifications of document additions, edits and updates on Alfresco (these will be sent to a dedicated public mailing list as soon as the notification templates are configured to contain more-useful information than at present).  I now have a lot more time again. Personally, I plan to focus on configuring and developing the Alfresco platform as my first task, working from suggestions and discussion from the English docs team and interested localization people.  Alfresco has many potentials as a working tool, for documentation work, for localization work, and for other areas of the LibreOffice project / TDF organization too. I continue to see it as an ideal tool for LibreOffice documentation, and want to get the Alfresco project involved in helping us get the most out of it quickly. I probably need to do more communication about Alfresco to the LibreOffice lists, so that people get a better understanding of what it can be used for.  But, obviously, no-one is obliged to use Alfresco if they have other preferred tools and methods.  In any case, I'll post again soon with more Alfresco news and ideas.  As regards LibreOffice English/localized documentation, whatever platform is used for docs team work, we recently discussed the need to finalize a document reference system. Notably it needs to be platform independent (fields contained in document meta data, for instance). That would be something we should do pretty urgently, IMHO.  David Nelson  "

IMHO, each contributor should feel liberty of action and freedom to take a lead role in an initiative, without feeling they have to defer to an official or unofficial team leader. I like the way people have been discussing and negotiating together about work, without any one person feeling they have a weightier opinion than someone else.

People will be able to see all stuff in any space, and download it. When it's publication-ready, it will be copied from the Alfresco platform to the LibreOffice wiki, where it will be listed there and on the main LibreOffice website (libreoffice.org).  When you do work, it's best to come and announce your plans/intentions here on the Documentation mailing list, so that other team members can advise you and be aware of what's in progress.  Insofar as you use the Alfresco platform for your work, there is not currently any \"acceptance\" process. What will happen is that another team member will take a look, and probably do the next work task. We'd only roll back your upload and reject the work if there was some dire problem with it.  Again, when you finish work, post a message here to let people know - although there will be a public commits mailing list reporting work on the Alfresco platform operational in an unfinished form later today.  Parichay, it's great to have everyone possible putting work in on English docs, but I'd also urge you to go on the l10n list and ask about localization work. It is likely that there is no-one working on content for your mother tongue.  Speaking personally, I've always felt that, insofar as possible, it's best to have mother-tongue writers doing the authoring, otherwise there is an extra job for us of post-editing to weed out grammar errors, etc. Although it is true that there tend to be more exceptions to this principle with English, as it's a widely-spoken international language. But, in any case, don't let that discourage you from contributing to English content if it attracts you more than working with your mother tongue. More info about localization work is here [1].

Plus, a team leader should only be appointed by team vote after a competitive process. And the term and roles of a team leader would have to be clearly defined beforehand.  A team vote by the Engilsh docs team should only be conducted among recognized and active English docs contributors who are accepted LibreOffice community members. The basic principles of the community bylaws would really suggest that.  The MC has only just started work on intaking community members, and so the subset of approved community members and active English docs team contributors is still very fuzzy and evolving.  The English docs project could only benefit from a period of competitive contribution between contenders for the team leader position, and there are a number of people that I can think of who have excellent qualifications (Jean included). In around six months, the LibreOffice project and, certainly, the English docs project would then be in a much more mature situation, and a defendable vote could then be held.  To date, I have noticed that every single active contributor to EngDocs (I just coined a tag for the team name!) has a tendency to need to go MIA from time to time to deal with other stuff in daily life (\"disappear off in the bush\"). And there has been quite some churn among the contributors. So you couldn't really take a proper vote at this time that could credibly be proposed to and defended before the SC.  @Jean: if the situation has now changed for you and you feel able to put contribution to LibO EngDocs before your work for ODFAuthors and OpenOffice.org, then that's really superb and what I've encouraged you about for a long time, on- and off-list. I'll be extremely happy to collaborate with you on your ideas and proposals for the LibreOffice documentation project, and to contribute helpfully to the work as much as possible.  @Jean, all: But, personally, I'd say let's put off the idea of any team leader until September or October, and work as from now on organizing a proper framework for things (the EngDocs project generally, and the possible appointment of a team leader).

The original organization was somewhat illogical and disjointed, so I cobbled it together differently. The modified template guide has a _mod_0 suffix affixed to the original filename, as a couple months ago I made several substantive changes to it and labeled that one with a _mod_1 suffix and added a \"changes list\" first-level subhead at the end of it, which shows the edits, comments,  and such changes from the previous versions.  The changes I made back then have not yet been uploaded, probably due to \"cabin fever\" here or the like, as this past? winter in Detroit (it still snowed in late April this year...) was/is at least two months longer and some 5 to 20 degrees colder than normal--with some 19 more inches of snow and 50% more rain than usual.

After the site was usable, replete with reports, you began getting involved and promptly erased every scrap of work the team had contributed since LibreOffice began.  What's more, you told us so and then went silent. I salvaged some work, Hal reimplemented some space structure and there was not an offer of help from you, nor response when questioned directly.  When Jean Hollis Weber noticed a vacuum and the necessity for our team to have a lead, she humbly offered her service. This is when you have chosen to re-emerge with what seems vitriol toward contributing members of the docs team.  I must wonder what your intentions are with this community.  Personally, I'd like to see one-big-happy. Currently, we are not one, we are not big, and we are not happy.  "

I don't really see why people have to get so intense about things, and why a subject and different opinions can't be discussed without a confrontational element creeping in, not to mention personal unpleasantness!  Some of you guys really need to learn some Zen. :-)  I am only one human being, and at the time I was working on the LibreOffice website - an urgent need for the project at that time - I did not have *much* time for contributing to docs, although I did respond to every inquiry and question on the docs mailing list. At the time, some people were pretty grateful for the fact that I practically \"dragged\" libreoffice.org forward to live status, almost single-handedly. But all that gets forgotten pretty quickly! :-D  As regards the Alfresco server problem, it was extremely unfortunate about the problem that occurred with the original Alfresco installation, and you can imagine I felt pretty bad myself. But you just have to count it as part of the learning curve and move on.  Now Alfresco is being backed up externally to a TDF server every 3 hours, in addition to complete server backups three times a week to an off-site location.  In addition, I've contacted the Alfresco project to invite them to help us get the best out of Alfresco within a short time frame. I'll post about that as soon as I have more news.  BTW, I have responded to the backlog of mailing list stuff having accumulated over about 4 weeks, and have responded to direct mail, too. Notably, I have responded to every inquiry and request concerning Alfresco.  Anyway, I've stated my opinions above in this thread, without unpleasantness or rudeness to anyone, and I stand by them. I'm pretty thick-skinned, and am perfectly able to take a lot of flack from people, as well as give it back in reasonable measure. And I still believe in LibreOffice and intend to keep working with the English docs team.  So you can expect to keep reading me on this list. ;-)  David Nelson  "

What I have learned is this:  1) People work in FOSS because of some sort of recognition by their peers (or by people they think are their peers). This brings out the best and worst of everybody (ego is a dangerous two sided dagger). So people enjoy the feeling that *THEY* did something, this is so true that LibO has a tracking system to show who is the most active in developing patches and in the Wiki / l10n. And as such people start thinking things as theirs (my contribution, my translation, my team, my work, my precious ;). But this all is not ours, we have forfeit our right to call it ours when we registered with the project and accepted the GNU / CC license.  2) People will try to undermine somebody who tries to take a leading role, it is instinctive: \"someone is trying to be my boss, but wait! ... I got into this thing so I didn't have to say 'yes sir' anymore\". And this is true and valid, I for one will not tolerate being bossed around even for a fraction of my free time. But without some sort of accountability, and without some sort of \"master map\" we are all going to step on each others toes (believe me ... we had 3 persons translating the same chapter of the GS guide ... what a waist of time and resources and what a bummer for the newcomers).  3) This kind of discussion may seem very tiresome (and I for one agree it is just that), but organizing the work-flow, and the roles of our member base is very important ... and must be done FIRST ... even if it takes a few man-hours away from the actual practical job at hand. I am not putting one minute of my free time in the documentation effort until I see a work-flow (I have too little free time to waist on a project I am not convinced that will be of any value)  4) Voting on the way we think things should get done is THE BEST way for everybody to get satisfied. We had votes on people who were registered users of our discussion lists, but voting within the \"actual workforce\" is best (get the GS guides and see who did what, those people's votes should be more important than anyone else's)  5) This thing was supposed to be FUN ... a little useful, but mostly FUN ... you see, documentation will be for a minority of users, most of them will work with basic on-hands knowledge of the product. And then there is the wiki and the users mailing list ...  the companies that will make the transition to our software will do (at least the majority of them) a in-house training of some sort. We start out as being EXPENDABLE, our work is futile and is outdated as soon as we print it ... but am I with all this, still having FUN? Sure, so I continue ... when it seems to much like work, I'll get out the same day.  This is not to say that any of you are right or wrong, but we need to get our speech in the same wave length. But just to make my point perfectly clear: This discussion is happening because people think the project is THEIRS (or at leas that they are PART of it) when the actual situation is that we are DONATING time and work to the project, we are not the project (and that is a good thing, or the hole project would stop if we weren't here any more).

He seemed unwilling  to go for a leadership position expressing reservations about it but i kinda  pushed him into it and that all back-fired on me.  Many co-operative groups run extremely well without a specific leader, running  by committee/council or by whoever happens to be most active in a particular  sub-group at that particular time (like a relay race).  We seem to be happily  going on like that already so i think it's questionable as to whether we really  need a single leader at all.     I realise that most people are more comfortable taking orders unquestioningly  from higher authorities and need to set someone up to be in charge over them  rather than thinking for themselves and taking responsibility for their own  actions but hierarchical organisations are much less robust than co-operative  enterprises.  What happens when the leader is away or orders something daft or  has a personality clash with someone?  A committee would deal with those  situations smoothly without any ripples.  Hierarchical organisations tend to  fall apart with even simple and obvious problems such as that..  I think this documentation group needs to formalise it's current structure (ie  what are the \"working groups\" = sub-groups) and just clarify who is  representative on our little committee.  Each representative needs a 2nd person  or perhaps each group needs 2 people to represent them.  At the moment we have  not really given thought to what groups we need and who would represent them but  i would say the groups at the moment are;    Alfresco web-site and very technical issues = David Alfresco work-flow and practical how-to = Hal Non-alfresco work-flow, guidance and tech issues = Jean  Ideally we would have 6 groups including some sort of administration / steering  group in order to keep people from \"ganging up on each other\" too easily but  artificially creating unnecessary groups is a very bad plan as it can just  create extra \"make work\".  For examples of good co-operative type organisations look at Mondragon in Spain  or Italy (i think) or Suma or Radical-Routes (or is it Roots?) in the UK.   However both the first 2 are much larger and more corporate than we need to be  and the last is extremely low-tech and might not even have a web-presence at  all.  Look up worker co-ops in your area and you might get a few surprises.   Here, just north of London England, we have 1 worker co-op that made components  for the space shuttles although it's more recent products might be less familiar  to home-users.  Most people might know of \"social enterprise\" co-ops or social  firms such as furniture, recycling or grocery stores.  I think it might be  because of those grocery stores and such-like that people don't take co-op  structures seriously but many high tech organisations also try to avoid being  too hierarchical because hierarchies are less robust and less innovative  (oddly).  This is all stuff that people working in OpenSource projects should already grok  right to the core of their soul  because it's exactly the sort of thing that  makes MS so vulnerable to malware compared to OpenSource projects which are  robust.     \"Just following orders\" has been a very poor excuse for some extremely bad moves  throughout history.  So, lets avoid hierarchical structures and keep things  robust &amp; open to innovation but lets formalise which groups are needed and  identify who is in charge of each group.  Perhaps we could have elections if  it's not obvious who is best at what.

I am not talking about a formal role or official title at this time, and @ ALL:  We of the Brazilian community have just recently \"enjoyed\" a big fight over the \"who is who\" inside the community (culminating with the extinction of the NGO BrOffice). What I have learned is this:  1) People work in FOSS because of some sort of recognition by their peers (or by people they think are their peers). This brings out the best and worst of everybody (ego is a dangerous two sided dagger). So people enjoy the feeling that *THEY* did something, this is so true that LibO has a tracking system to show who is the most active in developing patches and in the Wiki / l10n. And as such people start thinking things as theirs (my contribution, my translation, my team, my work, my precious ;). But this all is not ours, we have forfeit our right to call it ours when we registered with the project and accepted the GNU / CC license.  2) People will try to undermine somebody who tries to take a leading role, it is instinctive: \"someone is trying to be my boss, but wait! ... I got into this thing so I didn't have to say 'yes sir' anymore\". And this is true and valid, I for one will not tolerate being bossed around even for a fraction of my free time. But without some sort of accountability, and without some sort of \"master map\" we are all going to step on each others toes (believe me ... we had 3 persons translating the same chapter of the GS guide ... what a waist of time and resources and what a bummer for the newcomers).  3) This kind of discussion may seem very tiresome (and I for one agree it is just that), but organizing the work-flow, and the roles of our member base is very important ... and must be done FIRST ... even if it takes a few man-hours away from the actual practical job at hand. I am not putting one minute of my free time in the documentation effort until I see a work-flow (I have too little free time to waist on a project I am not convinced that will be of any value)  4) Voting on the way we think things should get done is THE BEST way for everybody to get satisfied. We had votes on people who were registered users of our discussion lists, but voting within the \"actual workforce\" is best (get the GS guides and see who did what, those people's votes should be more important than anyone else's)  5) This thing was supposed to be FUN ... a little useful, but mostly FUN ... you see, documentation will be for a minority of users, most of them will work with basic on-hands knowledge of the product. And then there is the wiki and the users mailing list ...  the companies that will make the transition to our software will do (at least the majority of them) a in-house training of some sort. We start out as being EXPENDABLE, our work is futile and is outdated as soon as we print it ... but am I with all this, still having FUN? Sure, so I continue ... when it seems to much like work, I'll get out the same day.  This is not to say that any of you are right or wrong, but we need to get our speech in the same wave length. But just to make my point perfectly clear: This discussion is happening because people think the project is THEIRS (or at leas that they are PART of it) when the actual situation is that we are DONATING time and work to the project, we are not the project (and that is a good thing, or the hole project would stop if we weren't here any more).  So ... are YOU still having FUN ?  Rogerio  "

There might be a nearly complete document that just needs a couple of paragraphs  sorting or something. I guess i mean that mentorship is not something a leader  should get \"bogged down in\" and straight tech-support is also not a function of  leadership.    Ok, so are the groups something like;  1.

Is Alfresco similar  enough to Mallard to make transition easy for them if they join us/you?  Now we  have documentation about using Alfresco it should be easier for them and anyway  Alfresco looks intuitive enough that they should be able to \"get it\" with gentle  nudges?  Would it be too cheeky to ask them?  It would probably help them to work at  documentation upstream, here.

Jean   Hi :) Thanks.  I might ask Ubuntu-Docs tomorrow although i have a feeling they might  not respond quickly anyway.  I thought ODFauthors was an alternative way that anyone could use to work on our  documentation and that which-ever system was used it would be wise for people to  say which docs they have worked on to keep the list informed?  So, i have  assumed that OOo people could \"get stuck in right away\" and then gradually get  used to Alfresco at their own pace?     My own feeling about non-English people writing documentation largely concurs  with Jean's except that i think it's friendlier and perhaps sexier sometimes  when there is a hint of foreign, exotic lands.  Even tho it seems to contradict  Jean's point I do also agree with someone else that said something about it  making it more difficult for later edits when people write in a language that is  not their 1st.  However there are many and frequent exceptions to that.  I think  the trick is to be more relaxed about those final edits and to sometimes let a  hint of 'foreign' magic slip through.  Later revisions are likely to smooth  those out anyway.     Regards from Tom :)  "

Certainly if someone is writing a draft, particularly of a more stand-alone document that isn't already in the Alfresco system, they could store it on ODFAuthors during development without confusing others. But people updating, reviewing and editing existing docs would need more coordination if they weren't all working on the same platform, and things could potentially get very confusing very quickly.   One possible scenario for anyone who seriously wants to stay on ODFAuthors is to ask someone to check out docs from Alfresco for them to work on and check those docs back in again when the work has been done. I've done that on occasion for people who have had difficulties with access to the ODFAuthors site; it's not ideal, but it works. Not that I am recommending that approach.  The ODFAuthors alternative is more viable for whole groups, such as the Spanish or German group, who choose to use that platform exclusively.  --Jean    "

(LO_master_summary.ftl was the report which lent a full project matrix-view like what we used on the wiki).  Questions: Should I homogenize our book sub-spaces? Should I set-up our automated workflow again?    "

Make the structure of the book sub-spaces the same for each book? If so, I think that would be good to do (I had not yet found the time to do it). Most of the books do not need the \"for rebranding\" space, of course, and I was planning to remove them when no longer needed.  I think we very much need the automated workflow, and IMO the previous one met our needs and was working well, so yes please do set it up again. And thank you!  --Jean "

For example, page styles are fundamental to using Writer, but many people coming from Word are expecting to do things using \"sections\" that Writer does using page styles (\"sections\" serve a different purpose in Writer).  Templates have some fundamental uses, too, that many people don't discover. For example, many MSWord users expect something similar to Word's normal.dot, and don't make the connection to using a self-defined default template. (Does Word 2007 still have normal.dot?)  Less specific to former Word users: Most people don't use paragraph styles, probably because they don't understand all the ways in which para styles can make their work easier... things like automatic tables of contents (using heading styles). For more advanced users, there is the feature for assigning any para style to an outline level.  All the cool things one can do with the Navigator.  Removing personal and other info before distributing a document.  Mail merge.  Page layout techniques: page styles, columns, frames, tables, sections. When to use which, plus usage tips.  For more advanced users: * Including chapter numbers in page, figure, and table numbers * Any \"gotchas\" with TOCs &amp; indexes when numbering by chapter * Various techniques for single-sourcing (creating >1 document from one ODT):    - Conditional text &amp; hidden text, paragraphs, sections   - Including sections   - Variables   Sound and video in Impress.  Cool stuff you can do with Draw. Several things in the Draw Guide could be made into articles, especially items from the Tips &amp; Tricks chapter.  More later!  --Jean   "

More thoughts, after discussions with people on the Website list as well as here:  * Host the blog on wordpress.com (which is where The Document Foundation's blog is located).  * Use the same theme as TDF's blog uses. This reinforces the brand as well as being easy to set up (no need for any graphics or much if any customisation). The theme can be changed at any time if we want to.  * Use the URL libo-docs.wordpress.com and the title LibreOffice Documentation Team blog. Title can be changed at any time.  * Set up 2 or 3 people as admins, so there's no drama if 1 or 2 of us are unavailable. Admins can make any necessary changes, but in particular they can set up other people to have Author or Editor access.  * As well as announcements, include tips, either short articles or pointers to longer articles or articles on other blogs.  Should I go ahead and set up a blog, or does someone else (who is also familiar with Wordpress) want to do that? Who, besides me, should be admins? David? Jeremy? others?  --Jean   "

I'm often not available or too busy to answer questions quickly.  The most helpful thing you can do, I think, is to work on rebranding the Impress Guide chapters.   This page has some info at the bottom summarising what needs to be done. http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development  It also has links to a slightly more detailed \"How to rebrand...\" document. You'll also need to refer to \"Producing LibreOffice User Guides\" (also linked from that wiki page), which should include details like where to get the template and how to apply it.  Jeremy (and others) should be able to answer questions about using Alfresco itself. Essentially all you need to do in Alfresco for rebranding is check out a chapter from the Impress Guide > Drafts space, download it (as part of the checkout process), do the work, then check it back in (uploading your changed copy as part of the checkin process) and leave it in Drafts.  As part of the rebranding process, you can (if you wish) check the contents against the program and update the chapter as necessary, including redoing screenshots if necessary (be sure to read the instructions in \"Producing LibreOffice User Guides\" about screenshots)... or you can leave that work to a later step, or you can leave comments in the file about things that need to be done (for example, mark any screenshot that shows \"OpenOffice.org\" in it.

While on the blog it would be no problem to use the main application icon (like this one: http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/File:Libo-list-icon.png), for iPads the question is a bit different:  We need to avoid some misinterpretations: 1) The icon does not open LibreOffice locally on the iPad. 2) The icon does not link to the official LibreOffice homepage. 3) The icon does not link to the main LibreOffice blog.  So the icon needs to identify the link target as - web based - being a blog - dedicated to the documentation team.  Adding some graphics inside the document symbol could interfere with the branding guidelines (http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Marketing/Branding), because the application icons is just a refined symbol from the logo.  For such a dedicated design it would be important to know the size of other icons on iPad, so we can include the possibility for more or less details our ideas and drafts.  Does anybody know about the size for standard iPad application icons?  Best regards  Bernhard     "

You bring up good points about being clear as to what the icon does. It would appear that the icons would be available only from the documentation blog. That should let the user know the icons link to the documentation blog only.  The requirements are for two images, one a cover image and one that as described, sounds like a splash screen.

As for writing in general, it isn't that hard. You talk to your friends, right? Well writing is just like talking to your friends. Talk to your friends, they are your audience. Type up your conversation as you are having it. Afterwards, when it is finished, go over it again. Correct the typos, spelling errors and grammar. Delete the expletives. Now ask yourself, \"Does it still make sense?; Does it still flow?; Does it sound like you?; Do you want your name associated with this?  That's writing. Marketing is another matter altogether. Marketing is knowing who you are speaking to.  I would prefer not to create assignments; you write about this, I'll write about that, and they can write about the other thing. If there is a part about LibreOffice that you use alot, a little thing that you had to figure out how to do that you may do differently in other office suites, write about that. Write about something that you do, that interests you. The good thing about blog posts is, they don't have to be long. A paragraph or two can suffice. OH, there I go again. Suffice, a perfectly good word but is it appropriate. Always keep an eye to marketing. We still haven't figured out our audience on the blog. We have few posts and only spam comments so far.  I agree it might be good to have blog posts listed in the social media. That is good but not good enough. The people that follow TheDocumentFoundation and LibreOffice on Twitter and Facebook are the choir. They already know about us and probably use LibreOffice. We need to get the word out to the general public. Post about our new blog posts on our own social media pages.

Tags are less likely to be noticed by someone browsing the blog. And they really don't need to be predetermined for the blog authors since the keywords can be pretty specific to the article.  I will say, though, Lana's idea to showcase a tag cloud is definitely a good one. You never know what will catch someone's eye. If you do add a tag cloud, I advise against an animated cloud.

In many cases I read them and realise there is a topic in the user guides that could be repurposed into a tutorial with a bit of rewriting and usually the addition of an example or two. In fact, many topics in the user guides began life several years ago as answers to questions on the OOO forums.   3) I have a collection of tutorial type material that I've written, which has either been published on my own blog or in a book I've written, but which has never been placed on the OOo wiki.

I certainly would not like to see the blog use that method as a standard thing, but if the article is in ODT and is longish and has many pictures, then putting it into the blog is extra work (which, for me, won't get done). See my comments below about using the wiki publisher extension. I suspect the same problem would apply to the blog publisher, but I've never tried it. Have you used it for articles that contain graphics?   I have not used the wiki publisher extension to post directly to a wiki, mainly because all of the things I've done so far need manual cleanup after going through the wiki publisher. So I send the results from the wiki publisher to a text file, do the manual cleanup, and then paste the results into the wiki itself.

Join their team, say hi and ask for an \"Alfesco\" login from them. 2. Download their Draw guide from Alfresco &amp; let the list know you are working  on it so other people don't mess up what you are doing. 3. Post to  their mailing list about changes you are uncertain about or about  any other issues that seem relevant. 4. Upload back to the Alfresco site, hopefully moving it on to the next step,  perhaps to the proof-reading stage!  The list are helpful about this process  (it's amazingly easy apparently) 5. Let the list know you have uploaded it.   You might also be interested in other OpenSource programs, also free but more  importantly Free, such as Gimp and InkScape.  Gimp is a lot more like PhotoShop  and there a huge range of add-ons to add extra functionality.  It's not really  designed for vector graphics tho.  Inkscape is designed mainly for vector  graphics but it's not a pretty interface.  Hopefully Draw brings in useful  elements of both while keeping a nice looking interface.  http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/ http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/InstallHelp#Installing_on_a_Mac  OpenSource programs tend to work together very well and tend to be faster and  safer than proprietary equivalents.

I think a dedicated page is more likely to end-up as a redirect.     Please feel free to edit.  Note that camel-case words such as OpenSource or  LibreOffice need a ! before the word otherwise the documentation automatically  treats it as an internal-link which would probably go to a blank page.  If you  can't edit directly please let me know if you want changes.  It's not all pretty  but some of that is to be consistent with other pages in that section.

I agree with Jean-Francois that the black border and large black triangle should not be so emphatic or heavy.  Part of the problem is that this sort of thing doesn't scale.  As we go larger, we need to go finer.  I also don't think there is any need to bleed to the edge, if that is what was done.  A modest line (maybe 3mm) and smaller corner cut are appropriate.  (And consider making the larger cut corner not solid or else much lighter.)  Also, going to a greyed (lighter) tone is helpful, as is done on the LibreOffice splash/main display.   I also agree with Tom that the border and the corner cut could be the same colors as used for the different document types.  Finally, if the border just doesn't work at that scale (because of corner-cut proportions), maybe something more like the PDF cover page is needed, but using the theme and non-solid colors instead of the black symbol that is there now.   - Dennis E.

Today someone wrote to the Documentation list to say how awful the cover looks, particularly because of the black border. I agree. I'm not a graphic designer, and I didn't have the time to consult anyone else... but the time has now come to do so.  One idea I've had (and others expressed a similar idea) was to use the colour of the component's icon for the cover border colour. I think that would be an improvement, but a more attractive overall design would be an even greater improvement. Other ideas are being expressed on the Docs list.  So I turn to the Marketing team, and in particular the Art Team, for guidance and, I hope, a book cover design. I know that this will take some time, so the next book (Calc Guide) will use the original design, but with perhaps a different colour than black for the border.

Thus far we have documentation participants from OpenStack, Mozilla (several members of their docs team), Red Hat, Ubuntu, GNOME, FreeBSD, and Sourceforge.  I'm sure that those are groups you would have heard of, but there will be participants from other groups there, too. Some of them may not be open source projects, but they want to learn about documentation using open tools and community-based processes.  The primary benefit to the LibreOffice docs team is to interact with people who (1) use open tools to create documentation, and (2) make use of community contributions to build their documentation. It will be a chance to talk shop about tools, workflows, strategies, goals, etc.  We think that we can benefit through your involvement, too. We want to know what approaches you are taking with LibreOffice.  I know that the conference is just around the corner, but let me know if you have any questions.

We could cover all the distros simply by saying  \"LibreOffice can be installed using the distro's package manager.\"     For more advanced installs just covering Yum, Rpm, Deb &amp; tarballs covers almost  all distros.  Although there are about 600 distros they all tend to use the same  packages, the same package-managers and the same methods.

If anyone has any comments, concerns, objections, suggestions, etc. please let me know!

I don't know what the Steering Committee, TDF itself or any of the other guiding instances of the Foundation think either. The fact that there is a lot of Java stuff in there as the basic underpinning functionality does not plead in its favour, that is for sure, at least as far as I can tell from reading the dev lists, and comments I have seen on the dev irc.  At the moment there is no attributed Base specialist programmer/developer in the LibreOffice project. That is not to say that someone won't step up to the mark, but the question would then be, when, and if so, would he/she be able to revive/maintain the module ? The way things are going at the moment, the headlong rush with which things are proceeding in other modules will IMHO necessarily lead to more and more incidents with regard to the Base module.  A case in point is my personal conviction that recent changes to Calc threw up an unforeseen problem with the Oracle Report Builder extension which is bundled with LibreOfffice (the chart functionality in particular). I can not prove my theory, not being a programmer, and it seems that it is not so easy after all to find out which changes in the git repo caused things to become that way, but suffice it to say that the ORB worked fine without interfering with Calc charting in 3.3.2, and then suddenly started causing problems when 3.4 was in beta. In between, there was also the code merge from OOo, so of course, there is also the possibility that things in that merge messed up the inter-relationship between Calc charting and the ORB.   And finally, is it usable ? Yes, but...  - the connectors (postgres, mysql native) ought to be rebuilt with each new build (this is what Sun always did). This is currently not the case because these connectors are not considered core functionality and therefore not bundled with the extensions or integrated into the general code of the product ;  - mailmerge is, in the eyes of many \"former OOo users\" (myself included), unusable, and the priority to fix it keeps getting pushed back with each new release ;  - it suffers from various string, date, configuration settings and formatting issues ;   all of which lead to frustration for the end user. Personally, I am finding it harder and harder to recommend LibreOffice Base as a competent module, I tend to fall back to OOo 3.2.1 or, on the Mac, to NeoOffice, because I can live without the changes introduced into LibreOffice since its inception. However, I can understand that every user will have his or her own particular needs.   We desperately need a Base developer - if you happen to know one, it would be nice if he/she could spare some time to help out the project :-))   Alex   "

        "text": "  Chad, it's great to have you on the team. When someone is working on a chapter, they are supposed to check it out so it shows a \"working copy\" in the Drafts folder. Any chapter not checked out is available for someone to review.  Most chapters of the Impress Guide need in-depth reviewing for accuracy and usability. The main question at this point is: do the instructions (originally written for OOo Impress) work with LibreOffice Impress? Are there any features in LibO but not in OOo that are relevant to this chapter and need to be written about (bearing in mind that we don't try to cover everything). And even when things are complete and correct, the screenshots may be out of date.  How long is reviewing expected to take? That depends a lot on the chapter and how much work is involved in following the instructions to see if they work. My guess is a first pass through a typical chapter can take anywhere from 1 to 8 hours, perhaps more if a lot of recapturing and/or relabelling of screenshots is involved. BTW, if you are unable to redo pictures, that's okay; just flag the ones that need work and someone else will do them. Obviously, if you've only got an hour or two a day to work on this, then it could take a week to finish a chapter.   If life intervenes and it looks like you won't be able to finish within a week, please upload what you've done, even if you keep the file checked out, and let us know that you've been delayed. Or check it back in and say you're unable to finish it within a reasonable time. This happens to all of us.  I assume you've read the document on producing LibO user guides (found in Resources), which describes what to do or not do when reviewing, creating and inserting graphics, and so on.   --Jean     "

Anyway, I'll add it here:  The copyright and TOC pages are in sections controlled by a condition statement MD!=0 that picks up from the first paragraph in the ODM an invisible field named MD which is set to 1. This causes the section to be hidden. Sometimes it fails, for no reason I can see.  First thing to check: go into Tools > Options > LibreOffice Writer > Formatting Aids and make sure \"Hidden text\", \"Fields: Hidden text\" and \"Fields: Hidden paragraphs\" are all UNticked. I can't recall if there are any other options like that lurking somewhere.  BTW, I just opened the orginal ODM and updated all links, and the copyright and TOC pages are hidden as they should be.   The incorrect x-refs are scattered through the book; most x-refs are correct, but some are not. It's a thorough pain to find and fix the incorrect ones. I normally do this in the full-book ODT after unlinking (embedding) all the chapter files, because I've found that fixing them in the individual chapter files and then recompiling the book often doesn't work "

I haven't checked in with the website list for many  months but i would hazard a guess that they have been discussing this quite a  lot recently too.     Some things had to be set-up fast with the best foresight available at the  time.  Since then much has changed and grown.  Hindsight is fantastic, if only  we could have it much much earlier!!  Any links that don't work may need a tiny  bit of editing but i suspect that the 'global' bit in the middle wont appear on  old threads.     Part of the problem with Windows systems is that they religiously attempt to  stick with legacy systems that really need to be thrown out, for example the  registry.  As a result they have to put a lot of work into propping up systems  that are vulnerable and in constant danger of falling over.  Oddly, they also  help make Windows unable to run on older hardware because of the immense size of  all that legacy bloat.  By contrast Linux and OpenSource systems are not afraid  to throw something out when it becomes a burden and as a curious result there  are a lot of linux distros that run superbly fast on machines that haunt peoples  attics or contribute to landfill.     It's better to make this change now than wait until the community and supporting  websites has doubled in size again.  Also Florian is not some supreme master.

When you create a mst-file for the installation that file is controlling witch language is installed. You can set all other languages that Estonian to 0.  You can download the official exe-files and unpack them to you server. Half way through the installation process you should abort the installation (you only need to unpack - not to install). From there you can create the new mst-file. I quess you can use any software to run the actual installation. I have tried with Zenworks as well as simple batch/kix files.  Regarding upgrading, I think (but I don't know 100%) that you need to uninstall the current version and then install the new version afterward. Perhaps there is some parameter to overrule this.

Vector graphics scare me a bit  but i need to use them.  The 2 main crucial ones, Writer and Calc, are done (i  think).  Impress is the most important one right now imo.

Even if  various sources and training guides are consolidated then the documentation is  still likely to be very sparse compared to the other guides.  But people seem to  shy away from relational databases or have put so much work into the one they  have that switching to a different one is much more difficult.     By contrast a lot of people seem to be trying Impress and asking questions about  it.  So, Base is less urgent imo and probably needs people that have a lot of  experience with it to try getting something together for it first.

On a Virtual Machine such as VirtualBox, inside your OS 2.  Run Ubuntu as a boot-cd, linux user would say \"Live Cd\".  Ubuntu 10.04 and  onwards tend to be a bit awkward but it might be worth a try.    3.  Install Ubuntu as a dual-boot alongside your current OS  I can help you with 3 (or 1 or 2).  For 1 it would help to know which OS you  mostly use.     However, if you are only doing this for the screen-shots then it might be a  better idea to leave the screen-shots to someone else and just let people know  which shots need to be replaced.  There are already a few people doing it that  way.  I think even people that do the screenshots and the rest tend to do the  screenshots in a separate session, perhaps getting a batch of 2 or 3 screenshots  (perhaps more) and then doing more editing.  The work-flow seems better that way  i think?

It's usually around the top of the  keyboard between the Enter key and the number-pad.  It tends to default to  saving the screenshot as a png on your desktop or perhaps in Ubuntu's Pictures  folder.  From the top taskbar click on Places - Pictures  There is a slightly better tool, again from the top taskbar Applications - Accessories - Snapshot (i think) It allows you to set a time-delay and stuff.  There was a discussion about  better tools ages ago but i can't remember the result.     If you want to edit the picture in Ubuntu then you might want to install Gimp System - Administration - Synaptic Package Manager and then either tool to search for gimp.  In Ubuntu 11.04 the menus might be very different unless it reverts to \"Gnome\"  or \"Classic\" desktop rather than the all 'new' Unity.

I have written several notes on this that you will find in the archives for this list.   Jean     "

That's probably a rationalisation, but as an excuse for not limiting too much the number of volunteers who can do screenshots we can use, I think it's a good excuse. ;-)   My only real concern is that colors not obscure the text on the screenshot and that they print well. Some themes do a reverse color for selections that makes the item very difficult to read in a screenshot.   AFAIK we at LibO haven't actual set a specific theme and style. My suggestion was for something that would look similar on most common o/s, but it was never agreed on. Neither has any other proposal been agreed on. Sometimes I get the impression from a few people that they think the LibO Docs team should do things differently from OOo just because it's different, even when the method has worked well for the OOo Docs team.

I have now sent him a detailed reply - belatedly, because of an immense personal and professional to-do list after the move - in which I CC'ed Jeremy and Samphan (active contributors to the development of the LibreOffice Alfresco) and certain members of the LibO dev team and SC.  The idea is to get help with the development of workflows for the docs team, and - hopefully - bring back life to the currently-dormant OOo Alfresco plugin [1], which could be very valuable as a collaboration tool if we can get it to an operational state with recent versions of LibreOffice.  So I'll be reporting back to the team on this as soon as I have news to tell, and hope to bring the conversation to the list as soon as possible.

The 'new' people that they are trying to gift the code to is a  charitable organisation called Apache.  Apache are on far better terms with us  than Oracle were so it has all become less critical.     However, we are now becoming more competitive with MS Office which is a major  \"money spinner\" for MS.  So, we can expect MS to chase us in various ways as  soon as they see us as a threat or possibly even before.  So, it's possibly  imminent and hefty so it's critical that we take away any opportunities for them  to fight us.  Replacing screen-shots taken in Windows is a critical issue.

So, LO will increasingly be  seen as 'upstream' and the best place to work on stuff.  To modify it for  downstream just rename a chapter &amp; delete sections on functionality they don't  have.     TDF are unlikely to chase people through legal action over a few screen-shots   or LO or TDF branding appearing  in other people's documentation.  In a way it  would be free advertising.     I guess that to help ODFauthors with future releases of LibreOffice  Documentation a lot of re-working sentences could be done to avoid words that  are specific to LO.

I think the Euros problem is likely to be a rounding error if the 9.87 and/or  the 6.54 are the results of calculations.  It is possible to bracket  calculations and use functions such as \"Round\" to round-off extra digits rather  than just using formatting to hide them.  Often the \"Round\" functions tend to  drop numbers such as 9.869 to 9.860, well 9.86 so it's wise to test it and then  maybe add 0.005 before rounding-off.  For example =SUM(D6:D8)/3 would become  =ROUND((SUM(D6:D8))+0.005)  There probably is an agreed standard to the way particular functions such as  that are handled but proprietary products tend to break such agreements and then  keep that secret so that people are confused when the standards are adhered to,  hence various arguments in this mailing-list.  OpenSource products can have  errors and mob-rule can over-ride most things but at least they don't try to  hide it either way even if it hurts them.  So, it's worth checking by testing  before relying on results.

Ok, again  -3 x -3 = 9  I think people tend to expect the - to make the result -9.  Perhaps they expect  the result to be the same as -(3^2) which is a completely different thing.   Again this is more about people lack of maths understanding than about  spreadsheets.  An evening course or on-line course about maths is the answer,  not documentation for a spreadsheet program.     In the bug-report the first comment complains that spreadsheet programs stick to   internationally agreed maths standard for the order in which to apply functions,   Bodmas (stands for \"Brackets, of/division, multiplication, add, subtract\").   Choosing a non-standards order makes higher functions exponentially difficult or   even impossible.  Before the 0 was borrowed from Arabic notation simple  multiplication and division was only possible by people with a university degree   level of maths skills.  Choosing to go against Bodmas would be similarly  catastrophic.  Business users like to left align numbers which makes simple addition more  difficult at a glance, for example  34  300 ====== 640  ?!!?  Maths people and accountants tend to shudder at left aligned numbers, or realise   they are likely to make a lot of cash from these people.  A right-justified list   makes it much more obvious    34 300 ===== 334 in a much more obvious way.  Ok, its a stupid example with only 2 numbers  in the list but imagine with a LOT more numbers in the list, say 20 to 30 per  page.     Back to the expected result of -9.  What is the square root? -3 x 3 is not  really right.  In fact we are now getting towards 2 dimensional numbers such as  \"imaginary numbers\" and perhaps even getting close to chaos theory and fractal  dimensions.     In the bug-report the first post shows a stunning lack of understanding about  maths, roughly along the lines of demanding that the spreadsheet program should  give 640 in my example of adding numbers.     \" I definitly see this as a bug and confirm it. Here's what I did:  1: Input \"=-3^2+4\" into a spreadsheet cell, result is 13 2: Input \"=4-3^2\" into another cell, result is -5 3: Input \"=-(3^2)+4\" into a third cell, result is -5  The problem here seems to be that the program attaches the negative sign to the 3 in step one before doing the square, which it should not, unless manipulated by parentheses like this: \"(-3)^2\".  \"  In 1 the result is 13 because the first function done is -3 x -3 = 9, and then  add the 4 to give 13 In 2 the result is due to an ambiguity that is normally resolved by using the  standards method of afaik 3 x 3 = 9, and then 4 - 9 = -5  People with maths  skills generally realise there is a potential problem with the ambiguity here  and might try fixing it by using brackets eg = 4 + (-3^2) which gives us 13  'obviously' since the inside of the bracket is done before applying the stuff  outside the brackets.    In 3 the result is -5 because the bracketed stuff is done first giving us +9  again, then outside the bracket that is made -+9 = -9 and then the 4 is added as  expected.     This is maths, not spreadsheet stuff, unless i made a mistake in how #2 should  be treated according to the Bodmas standards (in which case the bug-report needs  to be fixed asap) but afaik i'm right.  Even if i am wrong this is not really a  job for documentation except as a brief note that 'common-sense' sometimes  over-rides Bodmas but will hopefully be fixed soon.

At the moment, if you want to translate on the wiki, you have to have 2 windows open, the first with the original language wiki page, and the second, a new wiki page on the English part of the site. For me, quite frankly, this is too much of an effort when the underlying system already has the capability to link translations automatically to the underlying original document. I don't like wikis in general anyway because they tend to end up having stuff all over the place, improperly indexed or categorized and it just seems to be a free-for-all. The wiki was set up knowingly with an extremely open approach to encourage contribution, but the downside of this free ranging management is that anyone can contribute anything and put it anywhere they more or less want, and name it in more or less anyway they want to. So much for having a cohesive, easy to search, easy to update, and easy to maintain information system. Trying to find out whether something has been updated, or even if it already exists, requires a lot of effort on the part of those who are conscientious enough not to want to waste their time writing something that has already been done or something similar.  I can translate from German to English, French to English and back again no problem, but I will not trawl the wiki in search of things that \"need translating\" from one to the other.  Alex    "

This  wiki serves - according to its main page - many needs simultaneously[1,  see below], but at present in my eyes mainly for project coordination.  (B) By \"libreofficewiki\" I thought of http://www.libreofficewiki.de,  which is just an alias for the old http://www.ooowiki.de - a very good  source of specific information bits and Howtos about OpenOffice.org (but  only in German language).  (C) I don't know of other public dedicated wikis at present. However,  there are libreoffice wiki sections in e.g. the German Ubuntu Wiki [2]  and probably other, non-LibO Wikis of course.   (D) Finally, to complete the list, the wiki on  http://help.libreoffice.org is not a public (i.e. community writable)  wiki at the moment, it is just the wikified content of the online help  from the LibO software. But it is sometimes referred to as LibO Wiki as  well.  So what I've suggested to do is setting up libreofficewiki.de (see B) as  multilanguage version and translate the contents (I'd suggest starting  with English and then followed by other languages)  Out of usability reasons I'd not suggest to put such little bits of end  user information into the TDF wiki (A). At least not at present.   In times of OOo, the argumentation for using the wiki was different:  They suggested to put as much as possible information into the OOo Wiki  (here I mean: wiki.services.ooo..., not ooowiki.de) to make it the  biggest and best possible all-purpose knowledge base. Which is a good  argument, of course, but the problem is that for not-so-advanced users  there is too much information so the average user does get too much  search results and does not know where to start. All-in-one is only good  for advanced people, and if it can be filtered efficiently (e.g. show  results in one or a desired set of languages only).

I haven't checked this with 3.3.3rc1.   - Dennis  PS: In making a sample file to demonstrate this defect, I notice that the deletion shows  as text with a strikethrough at first.  It is when I do anything else that it suddenly changes to just strikethroughs without the text.  I think this is a bug I've seen before but made worse in some way.  The bug is that the subsequent re-rendering of a deletion actually changes it something else in a way that the original deleted material cannot be recovered by rejecting the deletion.  That gives me some ideas of some test files that isolate this, though I am not equipped to actually fix the code.  PPS: I sternly object to 3.4.0 not being a stable release and meant to be treated the same as a beta.  This was a terrible move, especially since it was widely-announced as availability of 3.4 without qualifications.  It should have remained at least 3.4.0rc2 until there was time to discover what regressions and show-stoppers had arisen.  The need for a 3.4 release celebration was not justifiable under any circumstances.  This regression business is very discouraging.)  -----Original Message---"

Die Auswahl erfolgt nach Browser-Einstellungen oder - bei angemeldeten Benutzern - ber die Einstellungen im Profil.  Damit die einzelnen Seiten (topics) aber bei Namensgleichheit nicht in Konflikt zueinander geraten, knnte man das Wiki z.B. so umorganisieren:  de.libreofficewiki.de en.libreofficewiki.de ...  Technisch gesehen wren das dann zwar getrennte Wikis, aber man kann natrlich fr eine Verlinkung verwandter Themen untereinander sorgen und auch ein einheitliches Erscheinungsbild (Logo, Name usw.) schaffen.  Diese Verlinkung kann aber nur dann automatisch geschehen, wenn die jeweiligen Seiten in den unterschiedlichen Sprachversionen den selben Namen haben. In der Praxis heit dies, eine automatische Verlinkung wre nur bei Seiten zu Eigennamen wie \"LibreOffice\" oder \"OpenDocument\" mglich, bei allen anderen wre eine Verlinkung Handarbeit (was sich aber nicht wesentlich von der Lage z.B. bei MediaWiki unterscheidet).  Wichtig ist natrlich, dass es ausreichend Beteiligung gibt, d.h. dass das neue Wiki dann auch mit Inhalten gefllt wird. In diesem Zusammenhang sollte man sich auch Gedanken ber die Lizenz machen: Der deutschsprachige \"Altbestand\" ist unter GFDL lizenziert. TDF/LO hat sich jedoch fr eine CC-Lizenz entschieden. Fr ein englischsprachiges Wiki knnte man sich also entscheiden fr GFDL, CC oder GFDL+CC (oder etwas ganz anderes).  Natrlich msste man fr das neue Wiki auch noch ein neues Logo entwerfen und dieses von der TDF absegnen lassen, da die allgemeinen Regeln fr die Verwendung des Namens \"LibreOffice\" und des Logos eine Lsung hnlich wie die fr das alte OpenOffice.org-Wiki nicht decken.  Ansonsten liee sich die hier angerissene Lsung in relativ kurzer Zeit realisieren, d.h. innerhalb von ungefhr einem Tag bis einer Woche. Was die Ressourcen anbelangt, so ist der Betrieb dank der grozgigen Untersttzung durch WikiWikiWeb.de und Freies Office Deutschland e.V. bereits bis Mai 2013 gesichert. Wenn man Anderes/Besseres wollte, msste man das jetzt klar formulieren, um weitere Mglichkeiten auszuloten.   Kind regards Regina  Regina Henschel schrieb:   "

I'm trying to translate Martin's main points and to add my comments.  Maybe you can forward this posting to Martin, I don't know if he is  subscribed here.    His point here is, that the GUI is already international (with browser  detection).   Nice - but it does not help to have an English Wiki GUI if the Content  is German ;-)    The idea is to keep the different Language versions in separate Wikis.  That's fine, I'd say. We should go for it, or better \"Martin, please do  it\" ;-)  Maybe a domain like libreofficewiki.org could better serve the i18n  idea?     The look&amp;feel of each language wiki should be adapted.  Ok :-)    Automatic interlinking works only for identical Page Titles.  My suggestion would be to go for manual interlinking first but to keep  the possibility open to switch to automatic interlinking later or - if  possible - for a certain section of the Wiki. I.e. if the different  languages have completely different content, there is no need for  automatic linking. But if the amount of direct translations rises,  automation can help a lot.     Heavy contribution is desired :-)  (Aggreed)   Licensing question should be solved.   (What is the best Licence for LibO documentation? I'm not an expert  here.)     Logo + Theme should be negotiated with TDF.   (Who can do this? Martin?)    The above solution could be realized in short time and the server  hosting is granted for the next two years.   I'd say, this is a good starting point for English/international Tips &amp;  Tricks or similar collections. But nobody can know if it will be  accepted and filled by the community. But it's good to offer this  possibility. After a year or two, we will know better.

Well, there are people who have been/are now working on the Impress guide and Getting Started guide.  Myself, I'm still in discussion with the Alfresco project. There are some interesting ideas in the air, but it's not yet clear whether they will have time to undertake a major configuration/customisation job on alfresco.libreoffice.org/documentation.libreoffice.org, or whether they might simply act in an advisory role. In the second case, I'd be looking at doing the work myself - maybe with help from Jeremy and Samphan, depending on their availabilities.  So, all that being said, are your plans still the same?  In any case, I hope you are having/have had a good break. :-)  "

At the moment some of those guides are not fully updated.  I'm reasonably sure  the Writer and Calc guides are done for this edition.  I think the \"Introducing  LibreOffice\" guides has got some new updates going through in the next few  days.  Similarly with the Impress guides.  Base is likely to take a long time.   I think work on Math and Draw are about to start (hopefully).     If you sign-up to the Documentation Team's mailing list and ask them you might  get a better answer to all of these things.  They are quite friendly.     The Documentation Team are likely to appreciate it more if you are able to get  involved with writing/updating the English (US) guides and/or get involved with  translating them into 'local' languages that are likely to be understood in  schools/colleges in your area.

And its for* free of charge*.  At the moment I am thinking about the way I could increase the knowledge/support about LibreOffice within my community.  There is a high possibility if the Document Foundation and LibreOffice Documentation Team allow us to print this book locally and and redistribute for free of charge among the schools and relevant places like public libraries.  As you may know Sri Lanka is a* developing country*. So, the cost of this book is not affordable to many people.  What I am planning is to write to the \"President's Task Force for the English and ICT\" and relevant organizations like Ministry of Education, ICT Agency of Sri Lanka, and National Institute of Education, etc by requesting arranging necessary for local printing and distribution of more this book.  They could find funds from the local or international sponsors.  I would like to here a positive response from TDF and documentation team before I write to above mention organizations.  I hope we could print and distribute more than 10,000 copies of this book.

Hello list,   Quite recently, I had a discussion with one of the system administrators here at  our university campus.  The discussion was about installing LibreOffice by  default on all new desktop PC's for personnel.  Apparently, the item has been discussed in an internal meeting, but one of the  reasons why our sysadmins prefer to stick with Microsoft Office is that it seems  to allow easy remote managament of Office installations.  For example (I'm  quoting our sysadmin here...):  * Group Policies in Active Directory allow to change certain security settings. * Windows Server Update Services allows an easy remote installation of updates  on all the desktop PC's of the personnel.  My question to this list is about the LibreOffice alternatives for this.  Does  LibreOffice have possibilities of remote administration and management?  Does it  allow a sysadmin to easily and remotely manage security and updates from one  central location?  Any help or pointers to websites where this is explained are more than welcome!

What do others think about the contrast?  Other than that issue, I find only a few problems.  Figure 4 (Special Characters dialog box) has the upper left-hand \"character\" selected, but that character is blank, so both places on the dialog box that show the selected chracter are blank. Most of the shots in this chapter are fine in terms of content, although I think the ones on fonts should probably have one of tne \"Liberation\" fonts selected, not \"Bitstream Charter\".  The labels on Figure 22 (The Table Toolbar) have numbers that are much too large in comparison to the text around them, and the arrows are much too heavy. (The numbers on the original picture are also too large.)  BTW, the note in the instructions about the recommended maximum width of screenshots is out of date and I will change or remove it.

Jeff is going to give me some mentoring, and I am going to get started with the practical implementation work as regards configuring/customizing our LibreOffice Alfresco platform. If someone else wants to give practical help with this, they are most welcome at any time.  Jeff is also setting-up an online meeting with the developer of the currently-dormant OOo plugin for Alfresco so that we can explore how to update it and get it operationally working with our current LibreOffice version. This is scheduled to take place during the week of June 27. Depending on how this initiative develops, we might possibly be able to envision integrating it into a workflow for the English docs team. I'm going to post on our LibreOffice devs list and discuss the project there, too.  So the first practical step will be to establish with the English docs team exactly what our needs and expectations are. Looking back at past threads on this list, I guess we can already list the following:  * configure user groups with properly-configured powers;  * develop informative e-mail alerts for added/removed/edited content;  * develop automated workflows for the English docs team (which could be subsequently replicated for other language projects to manage their own docs work, if they express interest). In connection with this, we'd need to establish whether docs team contributors prefer the \"classic\" Alfresco interface exposed at http://alfresco.libreoffice.org or the newer, revised heavily-Ajax-powered powered Alfresco interface exposed at http://documentation.libreoffice.org, or whether both should be available simultaneously, as at present;  * develop a special world-facing site on documentation.libreoffice.org and/or media.libreoffice.org to be a showcase and download point for the platform's content for our end users;  * optionally, depending on how things pan out, configure our Alfresco platform to properly function with the OOo/LibreOffice plugin for Alfresco, and integrate that functionality into the EngDocs workflow.  Please could I hear your comments and suggestions about the above? Once we get some kind of requirements spec figured out, the actual practical work can start ASAP.  "

Personally I use it most of the time on Win XP on 3 machines of different hardware and sizes, and on a network with 4Tb. of stuff on a D-Link DNS-323 NAS.  (Note: Since the DNS-323 is a Unix box and the drives are formatted ext3, Icons attached to anything by the user will lose their links to the associated .ICO files, but the rest is OK and has certain advantages. Other than that XP will see these drives as if they were NTFS.)  Other than that, recently in the updates for Fedora 13 on my laptop, I received a link that updated the whole platform to Fedora 15 (i386). This comes with LibO.  However the behavior of LibO or any other application can vary somewhat from one platform to another, depending on what hardware and drivers may be implicated.

Marc was looking for a similar theme for Mageia so he might be able to help find  a good one for Fedora, or maybe have an idea of where to look if you are stuck.   There are legal reasons for not having screen-shots done in Windows so i think  some people are just leaving the screenshots for those people that are using a  suitable platform and theme.     I use Ubuntu 10.04 at home and most of the machines at work now have that too as  a dual-boot.  There are a couple of machines there with Ubuntu 10.10.  I've just  managed to get my boss to agree to having LibreOffice installed on the Windows  Xp side of the dual-boots :)   Most people still use Xp and just complain about  how slow it is rather than trying Ubuntu but at least it's an option now.     Regards from Tom :)      ________________________________ From: Bruce_Martin  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] 3.4 bug?  Hi Everybody:  What platform are you running LibO on?  Personally I use it most of the time on Win XP on 3 machines of different  hardware and sizes, and on a network with 4Tb. of stuff on a D-Link DNS-323 NAS.  (Note: Since the DNS-323 is a Unix box and the drives are formatted ext3, Icons  attached to anything by the user will lose their links to the associated .ICO  files, but the rest is OK and has certain advantages. Other than that XP will  see these drives as if they were NTFS.)  Other than that, recently in the updates for Fedora 13 on my laptop, I received  a link that updated the whole platform to Fedora 15 (i386). This comes with  LibO.  However the behavior of LibO or any other application can vary somewhat from one  platform to another, depending on what hardware and drivers may be implicated.  Nonetheless that, and my main machine which can boot either XP or Fedora 14  x-86_64 can share the data and work with it back and forth.

This is a good example of the occasional differences between the LibO supplied with Ubuntu (and possibly other Linux distros) and the LibO installed from the LibO website. Also, at various times that selection was not available in the Linux version of OOo, so it's possible that it's not there even in the original LibO version.  Hmmm... another thought: on the General page, is \"Enable experimental (unstable) features\" selected? I don't know if that makes any difference in this case, but I've found that a lot of things that appear to be missing suddenly show up when I select that option.  We've handled these o/s differences in the past by using a screenshot from Windows and noting in the text that it's not found on all operating systems, or may be worded differently. An alternative would be to use a Linux screenshot (which I can provide) but include that item in the text with something like \"not found on all operating systems; called 'Load LibreOffice during system start-up' on Windows\".

The easiest path would be for interested individuals from ODFAuthors to become TDF Members and be associated to whatever degree OASIS/TDF require to offer them as participants on OASIS Technical Committees.  I can't speak for the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), but I suspect they have no need to support participation on OASIS.  That is to say, I would be surprised to learn that they are an institutional member or see any need to become one.  Perhaps that will change as the incubator process is completed for OpenOffice.org, but I think it is outside the lines with regard to how Apache operates.  I can't imagine them funding a third-party to go play at OASIS under any conditions.  That's completely outside the box, it seems to me.   - Dennis  PS: The last time I checked, ODFAuthors was about ODF in name only. PPS: I just checked on the OASIS site.

People would have grumbled  about your screen-shots if you had used Wine because that would be the Windows  version of LO, not any of the linux versions.  The newer versions of Wine do  have much tighter integration with most distros themes and stuff so it almost  looks like you are running native apps even tho they are Windows programs.  The  key word there is \"almost\".  It would have been noticed.     Wine is another of those amusing regressive acronyms favoured by devs.  It  stands for \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\" indicating that it is similar to an  emulator but uses a different technique.  In this case by running Windows  applications at the same level as native programs rather than by introducing an  extra couple of layers between the code and the \"bare metal\" of the machine.  I  don't know how the APIs are developed to do that but it's all very clever.   Apparently Wine can also be used on Macs to run Windows programs there too.   It's not always easy to use but programs run very much faster than normal  emulators and in some cases faster than a fresh install on a fresh install of  Windows!     My neighbour is VERY into Wine and keeps on going on about it.  I try to pretend  i'm out sometimes if he knocks.

The closest to code are schemas (in Relax NG in the case of ODF) for the XML structures that carry the ODF document representation.  The specifications do require expertise, but the intention is that someone \"skilled in the art\" could independently produce a conforming implementation without having to look at any code of an implementation.  (That's the ideal; I think it is safe to say that the ODF specification is still a bit immature in that respect.  It will improve over time.)  Programmers might or might not be inclined to do what it takes to digest one of these applications and provide QA and clarifying text improvements.  Fewer seem inclined to engage in the task of creating such specifications.  While the first-line of users are adopters of specifications in implementations, it is desirable to have participation of others, just as it is important at Apache and TDF.  It is just that the bug reports are not about implementations, but questions and comments on a specification.  People here who participate in the OASIS OpenDocument TC include Regina Henschel, who has been diligent in reviewing and questioning definitions of spreadsheet functions in ODF, and Thorsten Behrens, who does bring a strong implementer perspective.  Charles Schulz of TDF is on the OASIS Board.  There may be others but I've recognized these three in recent contributions on this list.   - Dennis  PS: I'll wager that the ODF specifications themselves have not been a topic of discussion among ODFAuthors.

Some settings and configs get  over-written .  It can repair a partial or failed install (or upgrade).     If you try a straight install  of Ubuntu onto the same partitions, when you get  to the \"Partitioning Section\" (about 7th or 8th page i think) choose the  \"Advanced\" / \"Manual\" or now \"Something different\" option then you can choose  the Mount Points.  Make sure the column \"Format?\" has no ticks in it.   Afterwards the   /home/user folder gives a good indication of some of the programs that had been installed  so just open Synaptic to reinstall them :)  Reformatting will obviously wipe anything on the partition so just make sure the  partitions don't get formatted.  One thing i found amazing about this was a multi-tabs firefox session that i  killed in one release using 1 edition of Firefox successfully re-opened all the  right tabs in a different release of both Ubuntu and firefox!

My appearance here has been urged upon me by Tom Davies, and I'll have to trust his wisdom on this, as I'm no expert. I do, however, keep copious notes on most things I learn about new software, and have years of work with MS Access, developing databases for my own use.  Right now, as I get the time, I'm accumulating everything I can find that looks like documentation for Base, while also rushing to get several databases up and running. I find Base is pleasantly stable, full of features, and not exactly well documentated. It's also slower than I expected, even with indexes in place (but maybe I'm messing something up, being new to this software). But it's a great piece of work, and I expect to be working with it for many years ahead.  I write a lot, and I'm very willing to contribute documentation, or at least drafts for others to tune up as needed. I know I have much to learn, but I'm on track with learning it, so...  I'm open to any suggestions as to where I need to go to learn how to be a better documentation contributor.  Thanks for your patience while I learn the ropes.

Anything you post is done as an individual, surely?

Friends of has an account with Lulu.com; ODFAuthors does not.

It would  seem that it would be dumb not to.  My questions were to gauge how tightly  integrated ODFauthors is with TDF and whether it might be appropriate to help  them gain membership, perhaps at a reduced rate or as part of TDF.     All the answers in this thread indicate that there wouldn't be much point and  that ODFauthors could pursue this separately if there was any point.     The gravitas of an organisation can increase when it can show that it is members  of or supported by or just working with other relevant organisations.  Almost  like a quality mark.  But it sounds as though that would be the only benefit to  ODFauthors and for the price-tag it wouldn't be worth it.     I've learned a lot about ODFauthors and it's all good :) Regards from Tom :)     ________________________________ From: Dennis E. Hamilton  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org Subject: RE: [libreoffice-documentation] ODFauthors  Tom,  I am not clear what the question is.  If ODFAuthors is not a genuine organization, I don't think there is any way for  it to join OASIS.     The easiest path would be for interested individuals from ODFAuthors to become  TDF Members and be associated to whatever degree OASIS/TDF require to offer them  as participants on OASIS Technical Committees.  I can't speak for the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), but I suspect they have  no need to support participation on OASIS.  That is to say, I would be surprised  to learn that they are an institutional member or see any need to become one.   Perhaps that will change as the incubator process is completed for  OpenOffice.org, but I think it is outside the lines with regard to how Apache  operates.  I can't imagine them funding a third-party to go play at OASIS under  any conditions.  That's completely outside the box, it seems to me.  - Dennis  PS: The last time I checked, ODFAuthors was about ODF in name only. PPS: I just checked on the OASIS site.  ASF is not a member of OASIS at any  level.     -----Original Message---"

Perhaps, you might save yourself a lot of time, effort, and grief instead by learning how to use PDFs more effectively.   Gary    "

The PDFs are primarily for the many people who want to print pages for reference, and for those people who need an offline manual, something they can store on their computer for use when they are not connected to the internet. PDFs are also good for people who have not yet installed LibreOffice or OOo or who might need to look up something on a machine that doesn't have LibO or OOo on it.  HTML is great for people who prefer to read stuff online and are able to do so when they want the info.  I do not think ODT is suitable for most users as a reference document, though it is fine for many and of course necessary if one wants to edit the file. Inexperienced users can bugger up an ODT faster than you can say \"don't do that!\" But they can't easily change a PDF, and they are more likely to already know how to open and read a PDF than an ODT.  A personal example of use: While I was travelling with my iPad as my only computer, I could easily store and read PDFs on it, or download them when needed (when I could find a connection), but ODTs were inconvenient. I eventually found a program that would open them (by converting to something, HTML probably) but there were no pages and some of the formatting was a bit messed up. If I needed or wanted to answer a question for someone (as I did on a few occasions), it was a hassle that PDFs avoid. When I had an internet connection, I could have looked up something on a wiki or a website, but usually I was working offline.  I may be unusual in my working conditions, but really this is not a \"one size fits all\" situation.  Errrr.... didn't mean to have that turn into a rant, but it did. ;-)  --Jean        "

So, you would have to employ something else for formatting purposes, much like CSS formats XHTML code.  In the (XML) structured world using Adobe FrameMaker, you could run FrameMaker in its structured mode using a DTD file for the XML structure and an EDD file (that a template designer must create) for formatting purposes. The EDD file would typically be imported into an FrameMaker FM file template after it had been previously structured via a DTD file, the end result is a template file that an author could then utilize for authoring purposes, utilizing whatever formatting the EDD file was programmed to provide. Not an easy task--the creation of a formatting EDD.  OOo really never did much with its so-called DocBook XML. In fact, what little it had was for the DocBook version 4.1.2, which dates back to 18 Dec 2003.  BTW, I have created EDDs based upon DocBook 4.5 and DocBook 5.x, which were generated by FrameMaker from the DocBook DTDs. Generation of formatted DocBook-XML templates for documentation-authoring purposes is typically a job for an expert, so doing documentation with DocBook is definitely not for beginners. If anybody would care for some advice using FrameMaker's DocBook 4.5 or 5.x, I could give it.  There are other software applications that could be used.

My view, which I have expressed on several occasions: Using DocBook files (or anything other than ODT files) as source documents for our user guides would be counter-productive, for two main reasons:  (1) It would exclude the vast majority of potential contributors to the LibO documentation, who won't want to have to obtain and learn to use a new tool; most contributors, in my experience, have enough difficulty learning how to use Writer well.  (2) Keeping our source docs in anything other than ODTs created using our own product is very, very bad publicity for our product.  Related reasons are: by using the product to produce documentation, our contributors are more likely to learn how to use that product better; and they may find bugs or identify places where the product could be enhanced, thus assisting the developers.  I'm fine with discussing tools for producing multiple outputs (HTML, for example) from our source ODT files. Individual members of the team who are familiar with those tools can work from the source ODTs, but most contributors would not need to use or understand them.   Some other forms of user docs can be produced, delivered, and maintained on the wiki: things like tips and short how-tos. But not the user guides. Seriously.  --Jean   "

As I said, a DTD file merely provides rules for structuring a document, but does not format it. Somebody has to create a formatting file and also a template based upon the marriage between DTD and the formatting file. It is not an easy, straightforward task.  Doing some small DocBook (XML) programming and formatting with very simple files would help one to grasp the work that needs to be done, though. For that, confer the Sagehill link for documentation on how to go about that. It would be good training in the event somebody wanted to ever go that route. Personally, if I were to go the DocBook XML route, I would employ a WYSIWYG app like FrameMaker instead of apps using a command line and such. I do not working all that hard.  In any event, it is John who wanted to take on the HTML-creation task. He will soon find out that today, one or more CSS files does the XHTML formatting. (I prefer viewing PDFs over most XHTML, amyway.)  As I mentioned before, I will enable the LO Writer Guide PDF for Adobe Reader markup. That would be a good markup exercise for anybody at LO who might want to copyedit it--or proofread it, assuming it is finished. And playing with Comment and Review (analysis) is also fun to do.

If a wysiwyg editor is needed thee are plenty of OpenSource ones but it's better  to edit the html.

There is  a security issue there. 2.  Keeping the thing updated.  I think wiki-pages are a MUCH better idea.  The links to headers and stuff is  done automatically and it's practically wysiwyg anyway.  Also a LOT f people,  particularly people interested in documentation already know wiki-mark-up but  don't know html.

There are currently several free readers for Linux and Windows. Some are considered better than Reader itself. Maybe instead of link to Adobe we have a link, if possible, to a FOSS pdf reader. People can still read the pdf and we promote some sister projects.  What some have done to get around needing Acrobat to prepare pdf's is use a suite like LO that can export the document as a pdf. Any pdf generated we need can be done in LO and we state that on the page. Any time we revise the document we do it using LO. I have been aware of this feature in OOo/SO for many years when MSO did not have it.  "

I've been in contact with Jeff Potts of the Alfresco project to see if we can't revive development of this plugin, and a phone meeting is planned to take place sometime next week. One of the LibreOffice devs should be attending the meeting, as will the original project admin, as will I, and the idea is to see where the code base is at, and what can be done about getting things rolling again so that we get it functional for LibreOffice.

So I don't tend to take much account of the \"political\" implications, I just see the convenience/simplicity aspect... So I see PDF as one very practical final publication medium.  ODF's .odt is the format for storing work in progress, although it can perfectly well be used for viewing documentation, provided that the user has LibO or another ODF-compatible tool installed. It allows us to do perfectly adequate version tracking and team collaboration. For instance, if we could get ODF integrated more into Alfresco, we'd have a pretty cool tool. That's something I'll be investigating/agitating for.  Practically-speaking, I reckon we'd be a bit short-handed to produce HTML publications, and I don't see a *screaming* need for it.

Click on \"Edit Offline\" and you'll be prompted to download a working copy of the document.  Beware! You will have been whisked away from the space you were previously in, and will have been taken to a space called \"Documents I'm Editing (working copies)\". If you want to return to the space you were previously in, you can use the \"Repository\" tree structure of folders (spaces) on the left-hand side and get back there in probably one click.  To \"check in\" the working copy you've edited, you would return to the document's space (or your \"Documents I'm Editing\" space), hover your mouse over the document, and click on \"Upload New Version\".

For all:  Being a long time techie who first got his nose into technology about half a century back, I love the open source approach. I think it is more socially fair to all, and that I see as globally essential.  When Oracle bought out Sun Microsystems, many of us knew that Open office would slowly become \"less open\", and it seems to me that a number of Oo users, (I remember one German engineer amongst others) wisely decided we needed a suite that was totally and irrevocably dedicated to being non-profit and open source.  At the time, I was able to use this on my Windows XP based platforms, but not on the Fedora ones.  Since then, I have upgraded the hard drive on the laptop I rebuilt when someone had walked on it and broken the screen. Instead of the original 160 Gb. hard drive, it now uses a Seagate Momentus 500 Gb. Hybrid SSD/conventional Hard drive. I Find that Seagate's interface technology for dynamically optimizing the use of the 2 storage areas and rendering the whole to the system as one hard drive works very well in Fedora. Fedora 13 loaded a fresh install like wildfire.  Shortly thereafter, I got an automatic upgrade that ended up installing Fedora 15, i386 on the machine, and that runs as well as any, although I found I needed to add Docker to it for legibility of the preferred icons.  Fedora 15 came with LibreOffice - hooray!  I imagine when I upgrade the other Linux installation to F15 x-86_64, it will also come with Libre Office.  That machine dual boots Win XP and Linux and can handle a third platform if needed, all BIOS controlled. It has 4 physical SATA hard drives. One, a 160 Gb. is currently failing, and in a week or so will be replaced with an SSD.  The purpose of this is for the swap files, so it is partitioned with 3 primary partitions, one a Linux Swap partition of about 12 Gb. (Lots of space here), and an extended partition.  The 2 other primary partitions are used to divert the Windows pagefile.sys (read swap file) so that Windows does not have to wait for the boot drive to seek in order to swap.  This, like Seagate's Momentus drives, should speed up the system for all the platforms considerably.  The third primary partition,. and the remaining space, can be used for swap files associated with specific applications, especially those which are processor intensive, such as Photoshop, Gimp, VideoLan, Cinelerra, etc.  I have yet to investigate whether Libre Office can use this kind of dedicated swap space or not, especially as I use Libre Office Draw extensively, and some of the drawings are quite data-large.  Hopefully this little message will generate some added excitement for readers about what one can do on a fairly frugal budget when one wants to enough.  =====================================  _*Tom:*_  Knowing you are in the U.K., and myself living in Greater Montreal, Canada, I get a chuckle at your comment of \"English or American\".  We all know that for any language that is spoken in multiple countries (What better example than English?), the computing world has to treat each dialect as a completely separate language.  Personally I speak Canadian English first, Multinational French second, and some Spanish third, and have given speeches in all 3, although much more limited in Spanish.  In Montreal, there is no majority. One can reasonably expect there to be 80 languages in a day. This being such a tower of Babel, I don't have to spend money getting on an airplane, the whole world is on my doorstep! to me this is great, Je les apprivoiserai tous!  The same in the U.S. there are about 10 Americans for every Canadian, and there's lots of variety.  Personally, I expect to treat each person anywhere for what they are and for what their culture has made them, and have fun doing so! so in the U.S. I absorb as much of the > or manners of speaking as I can, and can make others happy because I do.  I also can use snippets from non-English languages with a unilingual English audience, expecting them only to get a clue from the sound of it (\"vocal variety\" as Toastmasters would call it.)  \"Blimey!\" (smile and chuckle!

I had also noticed your very capable contributions along the way (kudos) and surmised when I saw you had gone towards LibreOffice that likely you and enough more were anxious about the danger of Open Office becoming \"less open\" on a gradual basis after Oracle had bought out Sun Microsystems. I also had the same concern, and am glad to see that LibreOffice is an \".ORG\" and does not expect to ever become profit-making.  I think in the current state of world affairs, this needs to be.  When I saw what was happening with the inception of LibreOffice, I went that way on my windows platforms. At the time I was not able to get it to run on either of the Fedora installations, however since, partly due to a hardware upgrade on the laptop, Fedora automatically offered me an upgrade that ended up installing Fedora 15 i386. This came with LibreOffice by default so I was happy.  Prior to that, that machine would not even accept F14. The upgrade was the hard drive. The original one was a 160 Gb. traditional 2 1/2\" hard drive. The upgrade was one of Seagate's Momentus series of hybrid SSD/traditional drives - the largest of that series (500Gb.)  Installation of F15 just flew! The Interface Seagate has used on this drive optimizes the use of the 2 storage areas and makes the package look to the system as one single hard drive. Linux partitions pose no problem.     "

Prego, (just watched Stealing Beauty and missing Tuscany).   Alas, the RSS feed does not do full posts.  Can you change that?  There are folks like myself who won't subscribe to teaser-RSS feeds: It makes us work too hard.  Other folks don't want full posts.  You might need to offer different buttons for people to choose their preferred feed.  (I don't know how easy it is to get WordPress to do those things.)    In the two months, there have been 9 posts and two comments.  You've got more categories than posts so far!  Although I am a very negligent blog poster, I think that not posting more frequently is a problem if you want more attention.  I don't know who the posters are, I see the generic Team poster and 3 named contributors, all with one apiece except for Jean.  There are no links to author profiles from the post timestamps.  That makes the blog too one-way.  But maybe you want to figure out what people would be looking for that you have to offer, beside announcements.  I'm guessing.  And what relationship are you out to establish.  Blogs are conversational.  Not fragments of user manuals.  The voice is different.  I have seen books written on a blog, but this isn't that.  For example, explain the way that the styles dialogs work and what the categories are, in small short articles in a series.  And screen shots, lots of screen shots.  Or just point out where the Page Layout option is and what is there, what can be controlled.  I have a question already - can I have a different layout for each sheet of a spreadsheet document, and can each sheet have different headers and footers.  The Page Preview is scary, having me think that I am stuck with the one, so I don't want to try making headers over different pages and find out that is not what I got.  There is no document preview print preview that I can find, only single page preview.  How do I preview the document?   Stuff like that. And more human presence.  What do you struggle with using it yourself and figuring out how to document it.  What is your most memorable duhh... moment.  I suspect writers may be reluctant bloggers, having to do with how precious the words are regarded, perhaps.  Yet some of the greatest blogs I read are by authors and screen writers.  But they talk about their experience, they don't put their writing on the blog unless there is some story they have to tell about something in their work or struggling or dealing with the publishing process, movie studios, publishers and having to do book tours, etc.  What's your drama around documenting LibreOffice?  Also, because this is where your audience is, things that folks stumble on when it isn't like Word or Excel or PowerPoint, and how to learn around in Libre Office instead.  Basta!

We had some discussion about what topics to include, how often to post, etc (most of which you've summarised very well; good to have that reinforcement), but as with most projects, not enough people to do the work.  We hadn't thought about the relationships angle, providing links to author profiles etc. Not sure whether most of us would feel comfortable about that, as it could be interpreted as self-promotion rather than promoting the Docs team and LibreOffice itself.

Notwithstanding, a lot of posts that plague blogging, and are more in the line of \"negative rants\" have made blogging in general more difficult to moderate and manage.  Still more \"notwithstanding\",  and recalling an apt point I remember reading in the July 1995 issue of CGA magazine, in an article about 5 types of difficult personalities in the office, where they were referring to the habitual complainer type, their point was that these individuals are more interested in voicing complaints than providing any aid to their solutions.  To me this correlates closely with the problem I mentioned above regarding the moderation of guest blogging.  Worse still, we so often see that the objects of so many problems and complaints are 2-sided wrongs or multi-sided equivalents, where nobody really wants to compromise adequately, nor even be open about that very fact.  If, being aware of that very concern, a person chooses to \"complain for the sake of complaining\" because they see no hope of resolution, that level, detrimental as it is, is also comprehensible.  All of this is so well known to many cultures, especially those which have been around much longer than that of North America, however this is where I see a major case of \"explicitness is of the essence\".  English is the most associative language I have heard of, however, especially in North America, it seriously lacks the vocabulary and practice to handle interpersonal and emotional difficulties well. English has its strength in the technical and scientific arenas because of its associativeness, but therein its \"Ying and Yang\", so little be it often understood here.  As a person who loves his languages, with English as a forst language, followed by French and Spanish as second and third, I see the mission to render the emotive capacities of romance languages into the pragmatic explicitness of English to take these skills out of the darkness of \"a black magic skill\" in which they have languished so long to the detriment of the better common good.

However, sales of the OOo books have now built up a large enough profit margin (around $8,000), I could use some of that for publishing through LSI. Of course, that's OOo, not LibO, unless the ODFAuthors group agrees to use the money for that purpose.   The OOo books are now bringing in approx. $150 a month. I forget how many copies are being sold, but of course there are more OOo books at this point than there are LibO books. The numbers will increase.   They can find out through the LibO website, through mentions in blogs, mailing lists, the users forum, and other places, from which they can click through to Lulu. Being listed on Amazon etc would be even better, but is it worth the extra expense? I don't know.

The differences between the more OpenSource  platforms and the Windows one are not huge.  The screen-shots can only give  people an approximate idea of where to look since there is a high chance of them  using different themes and screen resolutions.     I think having a more relaxed approach and \"showing off\" how customisable  LibreOffice is could be more important than branding and being consistent in  everything but a lot of people are arguing for a more unified, consistent  approach (which also makes sense to me).

        "text": "Now that we are getting close to having a full set of rebranded user guides for LibreOffice (based on the OOo guides), I would like to put forward for discussion some major changes to the Getting Started guide. (I have made the same proposal to the OOo group, but the two guides do not need to remain in parallel if the two groups choose different paths to improve them.)   The Getting Started guide was originally intended to be no longer than 200 pages, but it is now closer to 400 pages. I would like to cut out some chapters and make them into standalone guides, drop some material that is covered in other books and IMO is no longer needed in this one, slightly reorganise what's left, and add some pointers to the other books and documents. Details below. The main goal is to improve the book's usefulness for new users; decreasing the page count is a secondary goal.  1) Remove Chapter 8 (Getting Started with Base) and make it a standalone document. It is 52 pages long (longer than the Math Guide) and I think would be more useful to beginning Base users if it's standalone. Also, I think the vast majority of new OOo users will NOT be using Base.  2) Remove Chapter 9 (Getting Started with Math) because it duplicates the first part of the Math Guide and is therefore not needed here.  3) Remove most of Chapter 12 (Creating Web Pages) because the info is given in the guides for Writer, Impress, etc and is really little more than an export function; it could be mentioned briefly in the chapter on Printing, Exporting etc. Info on hyperlinks needs to be put somewhere else; I don't have a specific suggestion on this, but it didn't really fit in this chapter anyway, since it's relevant to more than web page creation.  4) Combine Chapter 2 (Setting up OOo) and Chapter 14 (Customizing) and leave the result at the end of the book. This is similar to the way the topics are handled in the other books.  5) Drop Appendix A (Keyboard Shortcuts) and put a brief mention in Chapter 1 with a pointer to the Help.  That's the major changes. I have a few other changes to suggest in various chapters. In total the reorganisation should cut the page count down below 300 pages and make the book more useful for the majority of new users.   Comments?  --Jean   "

Then just delete some  sections, swap covers and maybe screen-shots to re-release for OOo.     Judging from recent questions in the Users List a macro's guide would be very  much appreciated soon.

With macros there are likely to be issues that are fairly unique to each app.   Some things that people are likely to want to do in Calc are (hopefully) much  less relevant to Writer.  How brief to keep that sort of thing is a tough  choice.  Perhaps the introductory few paragraphs could be fairly similar in all  guides?  With Base documentation it might be great to copy that to the specifically Base  area and then cut the stuff that is in the Getting Started Guide?  As for email clients then i think we might need a disclaimer saying that they  are separate projects and then try to avoid corporate scenarios where they have  an MS Exchange Server.  Perhaps just cover the simplest scenarios.     I think i am just re-stating what other people have said but it makes sense to  me and sounds like a good direction imo.

From just the references I know of :  English language books : editors I have seen range from Lulu (individual authoring), Sam's, the \"for Dummies\" series, probably a few others of which I've not heard.  French language : a plethora of small publishing houses by different authors, mostly OOo/LibO module-centric, e.g. Eyrolles is perhaps the most well-known publisher. They also produce the excellent book on Macro programming by Laurent Godard and Bernard Marcelly (in French only alas).   German language : books by Thomas Krumbein, covering each module of the suite. There are others I have seen on my travels to Germany.  In my experience, it is fairly rare to see one editor publish in multiple languages, the exception possibly being the \"for Dummies\" book.  I am at a loss to understand why this might be, after all, there are a fair number of talented technical translators out there, but I suppose that translation costs inevitably eat into editors' margins.

I have thus far taught for 18 years as Math, Science and Technology consultant (primary and secondary schools); classroom teacher; computer classroom specialist and French Second Language specialist at various times during these years. I am presently off on disability for crushed spine and complications but hope to get back to class soon.  Cheers  Marc  "

Gary   Hi :) I agree up to a point.  Many people are sociable up to a point and often find it  easier to ask other people than look things up.  I can think of a few exceptions  tho!  People with even mild aspergers or other issues might tend to shy away  from people prefer books and computers.  Various forms of arrogance or honour or  pride.  Fear of being seen as weak.  Shame.  Fear of being indebted to anyone.   In many countries it goes against the culture and is considered rude to ask for  help.  Some people just love books.     Sociable people are generally the people we notice most often.  People that are  good at hiding away  are less easy to notice.    Regards from Tom :)  "

To \"check in\" the working copy you've edited, you would return to the document's  space (or your \"Documents I'm Editing\" space), hover yourmouse over the  document, and click on \"Upload New Version\".  We'll get this properly documented very, very soon.   The guides that need working on at the moment are Draw, Impress, Math although  people are working on parts of those (i think) so co-ordinating with them  through the sign-in/out sheet in Alfresco would be good.  The documentation for  Base is really bad, practically non-existent although a couple of people have  managed to pull a few things off the website.  Hopefully they are stored in  Alfresco ready to pull together.  Base is a bit awkward as there seems to be  regressions and quirkiness that is completely different between 1 release and  another.  There are no devs working on it right now although hopefully that  might change at some point.  Sorry for such a verbose email! Welcome in Regards from Tom :)      ________________________________ From: Gary Schnabl  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] getting involved with helping with LO  docs   The OOo-based, rebranded LO docs are not updated anywhere as often or are as  precise as to incremental-version updates as you think they are. The major  differences between their underlying, original OOo documents are mostly their  being rebranded from the OOo documents with newer LO screen captures and their  original OOo references changed to those of LO.  Perhaps, you might care to review and rewrite the various user guides in whole  or in part more critically? I am in the process of making the current 3.3.2  template more usable, with fewer errors. Perhaps, you might care to critique it.  As to markup: One thing a reviewer or technical editor should do is to first  update the latest version of the subdocument you are working on onto the most  current template version, if necessary. Then, with edit-tracking toggled on (via  Edit > Changes), set both recording and showing the changes on, and then edit,  rewrite, or whatever you choose to change. Also, you could add some comments  (aka the notes in MS Word) via the Insert and View menus. (You can also add  other comments via the Edit > Changes > Comment command to the edit tracking  items.)

It's obvious to me that for most people getting started with databases is very significantly more difficult than getting started with any other module of a typical office suite.

This serves as advertisement, and inducement to dig into the module further. That this may need to be done using separate documentation should be no impediment (unless, of course, it doesn't exist, which appears to be the case with Base, at present).  I can think of several ways to ease people into using a database, such that significant incremental learning can begin for them.

I saw many times in the field that there are usually key people who serve as conduits between formal knowledge repositories (libraries, book, technical consultants, etc.) and people who need answers. We call these people \"culture brokers\", and they are pivotal people in any major culture change process.  I suggest that technical manuals are not ever for the average person, or for the majority of users, but rather for the person who by training and/or inclination is at least somewhat of a scholar - i.e., they value textural repositories of information. They acquire this information, then pass it on to others. I see this happen all the time in forums and discussion lists devoted to various computer programs.  This is not a problem, but just a fact of how people work. When we compile succinct, accessible sources of problem solutions and basic information we are feeding the culture brokers. We must be at peace with the fact that it is they who take the information to the front-line user, in most cases. Over time, increasing numbers of people do consult primary information sources, but I expect that the majority will always consult other people first, if only because it is usually a quicker path to a solution.

This means that the publisher may not have even covered costs and although a German version was created, it was not released (because the publisher expected that they would not cover printing costs and similar). This is also why a new edition was not released even though I created it.  I had people tell me that they would never pay for a book on free software. One guy even emailed me and said \"I don't want to pay for your book, can you just send me a copy\". He emailed back later and said \"never mind, I was able to find a pirated copy\".  The incentive to spend time and money on the project with such blatant issues is pretty low.  So, I expect that the reason that the book is not highly translated is because people are not making much (if any) money on a particular topic, so everything is done by people that spending hundreds or thousands of hours because they enjoy it. Sure, a bunch of people profit from it (knowledge wise), but although it takes time away from my family, it does not pay the bills.

So while there are some information around, this is currently not satisfying for the people who need to know most of the new features. This is not only documentation writers - these are also localizers, quality assurance, people giving user support etc.  This was one of the reasons why I tried how a small specification can be put to the wiki. Once more people use this approach,we could just add categories (like NewIn3.5) and would have a good list.  But (i wrote this already at the design and at the German lists): although I personally think, that a (basic and not over-formalized) specification is welcome to most of the developers, hardly any developer will write a detailed specification on his own. This is not because developers are lazy - it is just that ~1/4th of the specification can be written by non-developers. E.g.  - you do not need a developer to find the correct place for a new option,  - you do not need a developer to know what the new label should read,  - you do not need a developer to search in the OOo usage-tracking data and identify how often a (supposed to be removed) UI item has been used.  - you do not need a developer to identify side-effects for the user's workflow  - you do not need a developer to write the help   Some of these tasks even *should* not be done by developers, because they (naturally) think more in terms of code (e.g. a developer's decision where to put a new UI element might be heavily influnced by the internal code structures - what is in many cases not the best for the end user, not knowing the implementation). But the developer needs to be involved, as she needs to give input about what works and what not (and developers have ego's, so even their opinion about user interaction should be considered ;) ).  To give you an impression about the work that a non-developer could do: I worked about 2 days on the spec (discussion at mailinglists, do some mockups / prototyping, search for usage data, document what I found...). The implementation was done in one and a half day - and it took only that long, because I never ever did contribute new functionality to LibreOffice before - during this one and a half day I learned how to implement new UI elements and store options. I even did almost three full implementations (the not used alternatives had been implemented for learning purposes). After all - the real code-related work was less than 1/3rd of all the work.   We need to come to a point, where non-developers help with all these things and collaborate with developers (code hackers). For this, we need to make people aware (what I did was just a test of what people are already aware).   regards,  Andr   "

This makes things line up correctly (especially with long chapter titles that wrap around) as well as making everything come out correctly when the chapters are compiled into a book.  This chapter needs to have the Mac keystrokes info on the copyright page. I think all the other chapters now have it.  I'm not sure how you're doing the changes to the notes &amp; tips tables, but it's causing extra blank paragraphs to be inserted. I have set up an AutoFormat for each of the table types and apply the appropriate one to the table, so the spacing doesn't change. Unfortunately, AutoFormats, like AutoText, don't get saved in the template.  Tables of data have a slightly different appearance too. Again, I've set this up as an AutoFormat, so it's easy to apply to an existing table.  Copyright page acknowledgements are unusually wordy in this book, and quite a long list, so I suggest a slightly different approach from the other books, as follows. Only the last line will change from what is now in each of the chapters.  This chapter is based on an original French document written for OpenOffice.org 1.x by Michel Pinquier (translated into English by Alex Thurgood) and previous content revised by Jim Taylor. The chapter was revised for OpenOffice.org 2.0 by Linda Worthington, Daniel Carrera, Jean Hollis Weber, and Agnes Belzunce, and later translated into German by Wolfgang Uhlig. The German revisions were then translated into English and revised for OpenOffice.org 3.3 and LibreOffice 3.3 by Martin Fox. Other contributors included Peter Hillier-Brook, Hazel Russman, Gary Schnabl, and Claire Wood.  I can make the small adjustments necessary in this chapter and drop in the pictures that I have available, then check it back in.

Yes - this is what it is meant do be finally.   This is not at all \"minor value work\". There is of course the problem that people tend to think that their own contribution is what really matters - for developers this might not only be a tendency ;) But this is really tricky, beause if no non-developers contribute to new feature implementation, you will very likely get a bad designed feature. If no developers contribute to new feature implementation you will get no feature at all.  So just convince developers to implement \"real good features or the users\" instead of \"implement cool features because we can\". This can be done best if you make them aware that also non-developers *do* contribute a lot and ease developer's job. (Again - I don't want to say that \"help\" has less value than \"developer's job\" here.)    Hmm .. I don't think, thats the problem.

So  although there are lots of good ideas that would be great to do there is very  limited potential to actually do those things.  Obviously actually doing  documentation work needs to be the priority.     It would be great if every mailing list had a couple of people on every other  mailing list.  I'm on Steering-discuss, Steering and Users.  When issues appear  in one of those lists that really needs to go to another one of those lists or  needs to hear about outcomes of discussions on another list then i can try to  forward relevant emails.  However just 4 lists takes up so much of my time that  i can't get actively involved in actually doing any of the real work in any of  the teams.  If other people in the documentation team followed the same lists as  me then no documentation work would ever get done.     There has to be a better way of getting an overview of the activities of several  groups than is possible using mailing lists.

As told in the other mail - it took twice the time to go to  several mailing lists and ask for contributions than learning how to implement  things and finally do the implementation.  If people want to change this situation we must do something - and we need to do  more than telling developers to go to other mailing lists. I want to see more  people at e.g. ux-advise list coming up with their own ideas an leading a work  item (instead of just following the developer's suggestions).   And I'm very thankfull for that.

The  threads are sorted into sub-categories within main categories that could be the  main groups.

The problem with asking for help is that while the question might seem obvious  to the person asking there might be a large number of variables that they might  be unaware of.  Usually someone in the answering team will ask questions to find  out precisely what is being asked.  Hopefully they might be able to take a guess  at an answer in the same email.     At work one of my colleagues said his \"computer was totally f@*$%^d\".  He asked  me for help but wouldn't let me see or handle the machine and wouldn't answer  any of my questions about it.  This went on for about 2 days.  When i finally  managed to get him to answer about 3 simple questions i was able to fix it in 3  mouse-clicks taking about 1minute.  The next time he told me his machine was  completely dead he answered my 1st question a lot faster so instead of being  down for 2 days he was back almost seemlessly.  The 3rd time he just wanted me  to watch while he fixed it himself.  After that people stopped bothering to set  his Windows to open with a single-click rather than a double-click.     Much the same seemed to happen here.  Quite a few people asked Andre  specifically what the text was that he wanted proof-reading and where that text  appears but all he did was keep repeating the links to the wiki-page that all  looked perfect.  As soon as we found out what text needed editing it was easy to  help.     The failure to help was not to do with the system nor the software used.  Next  time we have to deal with questions from devs we now know that it might help to  find the bug-report / feature-request thread at freedesktop or where-ever.

It may be more tedious for us to make sure our screenshots do not show anything that would imply a Windows OS but it is safer. I doubt any Linux distro would be upset if their desktop was identifiable in one of our screenshots. In fact a subtle plug could made by saying all the screenshots were made on various Linux distros.

You are the  first person here to mention Hungarian but it would be great if there was  someone on both lists to help co-ordinate between the 2 lists.     If you want to work on English (US) documentation then you might want to start  with Impress or Draw.  Find something that has not been \"checked-out\" by someone  else.  Perhaps something in proof-reading or somewhere?     Impress and Draw are both closest to being finished &amp; it would be great to  finish them.  Maths needs a lot more work.  Base is a major challenge.  Pick a  target that you like.  Check it out.  Do what you can.  Whether or not you  achieve your target check it back in after a few days and pick a new target,  perhaps the same one.

I would vote on you  working with Impress or Draw just to get them completed and out of the way but  the choice is yours.     The trick is to find something that hasn't been checked out by someone else.  If  someone has got something checked out and you really want to work on it then  it's worth sending them an email to give them a nudge.  They might have got  carried away elsewhere and just forgotten to re-upload it and sign it in.     Alfresco helps us avoid needing to have a leader that controls who does what.   Jaimon fell into doing screen-shots by asking a lot of questions about how to  set-up his system to do them and asked questions none of us had thought about  before.  I think he hadn't even used Ubuntu before but managed to get all the  themes sorted out and get good results!  Just a few weeks on and he is the  expert at doing screen-shots.

So, I have not been \"reading the mail\" in this and other lists until fairly recently concerning OOo/LO document matters. However, I thought from my occasional reading of posts in this list over the past year that Jean Weber initially considered the changeover from Winfows XP silver screenshots in the OOo documents (used by LO as the major basis for newer LO docs) as being somewhat unnecessary.  My point being: I, for one, will not worry myself or fret over any use of indirectly proprietary screenshots ever appearing in my own documents. That puts me firmly in the vast majority of writers or editors in this regard.

Sun folded and Oracle didn't feel able to continue running OpenOffice against  the might of MS.  Heck, Oracle couldn't even compete against TDF, even with the  head-start they had!  Apache are trying to give OpenOffice a go but seem to be  changing the licensing away from copyleft to their own, more restrictive,  licensing.  They appear to be co-operating with TDF rather than fighting it.     LibreOffice does not have the luxury of a legal department and does not intend  to remain small and irrelevant.  If your vision of writing documentation  is to  continue writing only for small irrelevant organisations/products then  LibreOffice is not really the right place for you.

        "text": "Hi,    The relevant legal issue is the that the copyright is valid and will be valid for many more years on Windows design elements. Under US copyright law the minimum length of a valid copyright is something like 70 years, so the XP copyrights will be valid for about another 60 years or so. The are two safe ways to avoid being sued: get permission from the copyright owner or do not infringe at all. The permission should be in writing, signed by authorized owner representative. To my knowledge the TDF does not have permission from Microsoft for use in of MS elements in a screenshot.  The only way the copyright can expire before its statuary term is for the owner to put the work (as it is called) into the public domain. Alternatively they can issue the work under a creative commons or \"copyleft\" type grant allowing users to use the work freely with possible stipulations about attribution. To my knowledge MS has not done either for the Windows design elements.  To gave an example, as an amateur photographer I own the copyright to all my photos from the moment of creation under US copyright law. Unless I grant you permission to use any of my photos I have the legal right to sue for damages and will probably win. I can give different people/groups different permissions for the some the work.   If something is a trademark, the trademark holder must show that they will defend their trademark. Translation, they must sue trademark infringers aggressively or risk losing the trademark and any related brand value from it. This is different from copyright where the owner is not obligated to aggressively protect the copyright from infringement. I do not know what is specifically a trademark on the Windows GUI nor do I want find out by being sued. Coca-Cola is very aggressive about protecting their trademark \"Coke\" from infringement. If you call a cola you server in your cafe Coke, it had better be Coke and not Pepsi or some other cola. Coca-Cola is known to sue over this.  The fact that others may use something without getting permission does not mean that we should also. It is not a valid defense in court.  I suspect that most publishers know enough to get the appropriate permissions prior to publishing and releasing a work. It is possible they could a blanket agreement allowing certain uses for any work published during the agreement term.  "

Of course, those sponsors paid Seinfeld to display their products in the first place.  Myself, I tend not to take very seriously any very remote possibility of lawsuits from such indirect exposure of Windows XP (or whatever) screen captures in documents. Of course, one should request permission from any such copyright holders for that purpose. My guess is that Microsoft could not be bothered one way or the other with this outside of being a drain on its resources, as that would be simply time-consuming, not cost-effective nonsense (meaning, extra co$t$) in their doing so. If this peripheral area was of any real concern to Microsoft, they surely would have responded by now in a material manner to this during the past two-plus decades that their Windows products were employed as GUIs.  Again, I repeat my surmise that Microsoft would not ever be concerned about this area unless their intellectual property were to be employed in an instance that portrayed them in a very bad light.

Alfresco Share is exposing at http://documentation.libreoffice.org, and is the newer interface on which the Alfresco project is focusing its development work.  Exposing only one of the two interfaces would simplify the work of development and documentation of workflows, and would decrease the exposure to potential hacking.  a) Does anyone have a particular preference for one or other interface?

The problem seems to be with accented characters in the folder (\"space\") names, although actual files in folders can contain accented characters in text. It's obviously a major disadvantage for NL projects (although this problem does not exist with Alfresco Explorer at http://alfresco.libreoffice.org).  I renamed a couple of the folders (\"spaces\") minus the accents. Feel free to correct the spellings and put the accents back.  I'll be taking this up with the Alfresco project ASAP to find a solution, although there is now a new version of Alfresco out (we're running 3.4c and 3.4d has been released). So I'll envision doing an upgrade very soon. Simply doing that might fix things.  I'll report back on the issue as soon as possible.  In any case, in the meantime, all NL content can be accessed and worked on via Alfresco Explorer (http://alfresco.libreoffice.org).

My inclination would be to go ahead with the upgrade, but I wanted to ask for your opinions first.  If there were no comments or if the consensus was to upgrade, I'd probably work on it at sometime over the next week, after properly backing-up our content and preparing for a rollback if needed.  Similarly, I'd be inclined to retire the Explorer interface and just keep the Share interface, because this would make it simpler to learn and document how to use Alfresco.  Any thoughts about this?

Might be some other things people commonly do that are not covered in the current book, that should be added.  Probably this would include some reorganisation of topics within chapters and/or the sequence of chapters in the book.  2. Extras (or Advanced?)  This volume would contain Chapters 13 through 16 of the current book, plus the bibliographies section of Chapter 12 (and possibly the indexes section of Ch12), new information on linking or embedding spreadsheets, audio, and video in Writer documents, info on macros (especially recording), possibly info on xforms. May be other topics to include, such as Writer/Web.  Depending on the reactions to this proposal, I will post a draft set of tables of contents.

There are at  least 2 people that joined Documentation specifically to work on it rather than  on other guides.  The problem seems to be that Base is a bit quirky and keeps  suffering odd regressions.  What works and what doesn't is very unpredictable in  each release and even what 'should' work is not always clear.     We need to attract devs to work on Base.  At the moment there are none  apparently.  Perhaps now that IBM contributed all that code to Apache the  OpenOffice Base might take a large step forwards but again that makes LO's Base  difficult to write for unless we can get that code base into LO too.

Having the option to download or buy an entire guide such as Writer is great.  I  don't see the advantage in splitting those large guides into smaller chunks  until the guides reach the size of MS Office's vast tomes.  I think it would  just make things confusing especially when some people think macros are very  basic but others don't.  Could the intended effect be achieved just by putting  \"(Advanced)\" in the chapters' titles?

One problem I've seen over the years is the lack of people willing and able to write new material, especially on more difficult or complex topics. The Base Guide is a major example.

Many things that used to work in OOo 3.2.x, and for which the pre-existing OOo Base documentation was written, now either no longer work at all, or only partially.  Paradoxically, the built-in help was actually much more detailed in OOo before the switch to HC2/wiki-help, and since then it has been quite simply unhelpful. Try carrying out a meaningful search in the Base help and you will soon find out why, it is enough to drive anyone nuts.  Add to that the new features that were added to OOo during 3.x codebase development, many of which were either not fully functional (charts in reports), buggy (SQL parser engine), or quite simply got screwed up when the LibreOffice project took over (see current Base bug list), and you have a documenter's nightmare in the making. The bug fixes to Base that the OOo developers had in their child workspaces whilst Oracle was pulling the plug on OOo have not been integrated into the LibreOffice code because there is a lack of clarity as to whether these are indeed freely available (since by their very nature, they were CWSes by Oracle employees, not trunk code, and thus not yet approved for submission into the main source tree).    The devs would not only need to work on Base to patch it up, but also provide documentation for the functions that get developed / completed / corrected.  As for the Apache project, I can't see it being able to produce anything of that ilk in any short timeframe, as the people there are still trying to work out which bits of code they are actually allowed to integrate into their source tree. They are still faced with many licensing issues about various parts of their project, including how, or whether to, host the documentation that has accrued over the years within the OOo project, because a lot of it is under an Apache-incompatible licence. Things might get sorted out, but it will be later, rather than sooner.  To put it bluntly, Base is currently in some kind of interdimensional space where it is being left to degenerate as other parts of the code progress.   Alex   "

I prefer to get one large PDF containing all the info and being easily navigable with links in the TOC and cross-references in the text, where appropriate. I don't particularly want to download and open several docs when researching the same subject.  My perception of the book buyer market is that they'd be likely to be tempted either by very advanced reference works containing material that might not get into the normal user's guide.  Alternatively, they'd perhaps be up for things like printed memory joggers and \"quick reference material\" to have at hand or on a wall nearby. You can probably image the kind of material I'm thinking of - the kind of stuff it's really most convenient to have on paper rather than on-screen.  Or perhaps tackle the real beginners market with kind-of \"Dummy's Guide\" type books or text books suitable for children and students?  But, for me at least, it would fall into a niche apart from our standard documentation such as we're working up at the moment.  Anyway, those were just a few additional reflections...   Well, I'm not sure that's necessarily entirely true... as I said above, perhaps it's more a question of identifying user bases who prefer to work with printed material, and material that is more meaningful, practical and useful when it's on paper, on your wall, etc...

        "text": "Hi :) We need to attract some devs to this project.  Preferably paid devs because  there is a bit of a quagmire trying to work out which patches have which  licences and so which cannot be incorporated into the LGPL and which can.  It  needs people that work like devs but also people that like to research like  documenters.  Could we get Wikipedia, Google, RedHat, Cannonical and others to  stump up some cash for this?  Could TDF itself afford to pay for it?  I think we  need a couple of full-time paid researchers and a paid dev to start things  moving.  I think those researchers could move into coding or documentation after  even perhaps just 3 - 6 months with any luck.  How could we get this going  forwards before the whole Suite falls over due to the 1 app's failures?

My MySQL database \"serves\" a windband and all the issues related to such an animal (eg. repertoire, uniforms, members, contacts, concert programmes, etc., etc.). Of course my tables are small compared to what I used to see when working with DB2 at large IBM-customers. \"Big\" tables might have some 30.000 tuples in them, so just looking for a particular item using a filter such as \"like name*\" never takes long. On the other hand, I have been complaining about problems using the report writer for serial letters. Conditions based on variables in a table are not handled correctly in the Linux 3.3.3 version (they seem th work under Windows!!). I REALLY depend on BASE not falling behind or on its face altogether. So I also think that some emphasis should be place on it. Unfortunately I neither have the knowledge nor the time to devote myself to such an effort... Regards from Austria H. Stoellinger      "

Jean   Hi :) I had forgotten that we had already discussed all that.  I had not read the  macro chapters until after reading Jean's post.  The one in the GS Guide looks  excellent and very generic.  If it is easy to have that in all the guides then i  think it makes the books sold by Lulu more complete.     The Calc Guides' chapter on Macros demands that people read the one in the GS  Guide first.  I think it would be better to include the GS chapter in the Calc  Guide being sold at Lulu now that we have a neat way of doing that without  risking  fragmentation.     Macros are possibly more heavily used in Calc than in any other of the apps  (apart from Base, possibly) so having 2 chapters there for it makes sense.  With  the other 4 apps it would be nice to include the same chapter that is in the GS  \"just in case\".  I don't think they need anything more than that.     Just my first thoughts tho,  I'm fairly sure most people have thought about it a  lot more than me.    Regards from Tom :)  "

        "text": "Hi :) At the moment i don't think details such as that really matter.  It's more  important to focus on just getting through the guides quickly and getting the  first releases \"out there\" asap.  Later on, in the next releases, it might be  good to agree on details and get things more consistent.  At the moment we just  need the first releases \"out there\" fast.      I mostly work in forums,  mailing lists and direct contact trying to help people  by pointing them to the right pages (or chapters) in documentation so \"my take\"  might be very different.     I tend to favour \"Camel Case\" for words that are joined together, eg  QuickStarter, LibreOffice and i also do that with widely used acronyms such as  Ram, Cpu, Gnu, Wine, LxDE to avoid  suddenly shouting out a word that is  becoming quite common place.     If i have to spell out what the acronym stands for then i use capitals that  first time.  For example GNU (=Gnu is Not Unix) and WINE (=Wine Is Not an  Emulator) and i have started using that unnecessary = sign to clarify what the  brackets are about.  I've probably been dealing with a lot of people that are  not used to reading lately and the annoying = seems to help.  People seem to  either ignore it, find it friendly, or appreciate it - i've not had much  feedback about it but had less follow-up questions when i use it.  I've not had  any complaints which is amazing imo.  Obviously there are exceptions such as  KDE, USA, GB (=Great Britain) although i do tend to do Uk and Gb (=Giga-bytes).  For the specific examples already mentioned i would favour   toolbar,  QuickStarter,  AutoRecovery (or perhaps auto-recovery if pushed)  I think i would prefer that contributors get mentioned vertically or in columns,  even if their work has subsequently been overwritten or replaced.  I prefer most  recent on top or alphabetically but again these are finesses that can be left  for now and sorted out in subsequent releases, after there has been discussion  to vote on preferences.  There is a guide about what work needs to be done (i think) urgently in some  sort of \"Resources\" section or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\"?

So we'd have \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide > V3.3.x\" and \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide > V3.4.x\"  Then we could move the Drafts, Proofread, Reviewed and Published folders under \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide\" into \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide > V3.3.x\", create \"English Content > Documentation > Writer Guide > V3.4.x\" and duplicate the  Drafts, Proofread, Reviewed and Published folders there for updating then.  I think that this would be the better solution from the viewpoint of the groups and permissions we'll set up after discussing the details on the list. Does that seem OK to you?   I'd love to get the versioning info out of the file name and into the document's meta data, so that - for instance - \"0101GS34-ChapterTitle.odt\" would become \"ChapterTitle.odt\" and that doc's meta data contains all the info we want to store about that doc. I remember we had a thread about this a few months ago, but we didn't reach a final decision about it, although you mentioned a number of items that should go in the meta data (I can dig that out when I get time today or tomorrow).  If we did decide to do as described above, I guess it would be rational to do it now before spawning the 3.4 docs. It would involve renaming every doc and inserting meta data; I'm perfectly OK to take part in that job or even do it all myself once/if we have agreed on the meta data. I could manage in in a pre-announced and approved one-day session, so that work does not get held up for other people. But guys would have to check-in all checked-out docs beforehand, and then check them out again after the process was finished.  (Alfresco can happily display a document's meta data, so it's not a problem of not being able to identify and distinguish between documents and versions).  What are everyone's thoughts about that?   Yes, I agree... many users might not upgrade to 3.4 for quite a while yet.   Yes, I guess so... Until such time as I get alfresco.libreoffice.org and media.libreoffice.org sorted out, I probably would not play a major part in that...   So what do we decide in the end? Go with your XP silver theme? Use the default theme from whatever distrib or OS the screenshooting person uses? Are we agreed that Windows screenshots are OK subsequent to the SC's kind-of pronunciation/recommendation about that? Or do we recommend a particular theme that can be availed in Windows/Mac/*nix versions? Or do we pragmatically accept whatever we can get from contributors, making the \"entry barrier\" as low as possible?  The word \"pragmatically\" sort-of suggests my own POV, but I'll go with whatever decision you and the team arrive at (unless other team members strongly and rapidly veto your recommendation, I think we should adopt it and move on quickly).   My own POV would be to make that a low priority or prefer to press ahead with new stuff. But I'll be guided by what you feel is best and +1 whatever you recommend (which I reckon we should adopt unless there is a strong veto by other team members).   Nothing I can think of.  "

The GS chapter on  \"Getting Started with Writer\" would be the same as the Writers Guide's  \"Introducing Writer\" and editing either in Alfresco would automatically update  the other.     There is extra info in the Writers Guide's Intro that is basically a brief  overview of LibreOffice generally.  The info there is fairly much the same in  all the other guides so could it form a separate chapter, probably just 2  pages.  Again, editing it in any guide would update the chapter in all guides.     We talked about this sort of thing briefly a few weeks ago in regards to the  Macros Chapter but i am still not certain about how feasable it is or even  whether it would be wise or not.     I think it would help each guide be a \"stand alone\" guide.  At the moment to  understand the Calc chapter on \"Macros\" people have to get the Getting Started  Guide.  It might help to consolidate the works and reduce the currently  duplicated workload for a few chapters.  It might make it easier for ODFauthors,  NeoOffice and Apache to adapt your guides to their forks = which would make this  team their upstream leader  :)  Obviously there would be disadvantages too, such as issues about context,  perhaps making guides a little larger, confusion for new editors.

There is a DocPlan and some work done by students earlier, which could be a starting point, but IMO it's really too low-level. Their work might go better into a guide aimed at high-school or university students.

It's fairly straightforward but can be confusing to uninitiated members of the group, and it doesn't work quite the way you may be envisioning.

IMO at this point the best way forward for 3.4 is to update using that theme when updated pix are needed. 3.4.2 is out and live; let's get the updates done ASAP, so we're not still mucking around with them when the next release hits us.  At the same time we can consider what to do for a later (major) release, which is IMO a better time to be changing the \"look\" in any major way.  More comments below.    I don't know who else \"quite liked the idea of using a variety of themes\". *I* certainly didn't; I jokingly said it might have its merits, but the only reason I've supported not spending the time to deliberately change all the pix to a common theme is pragmatic: lack of time and people to do it, for no real advantage to users.    You have your timeline a bit mixed up. The silver theme was the original theme used in the OOo docs (with a few odd pix taken by other people, either on Windows or on Linux using a variety of other themes) and was not changed during the initial rebranding to LibO. The suggestion to use a different theme came while I was offline for several days, but by then several people had already started redoing Windows pix using one of the Ubuntu themes that didn't reproduce well in grayscale, so I nagged about it.

At this point let's not reorganise content or drop chapters as I proposed earlier.  4) Make any necessary corrections to known errors in the docs, and replace any remaining screenshots that show OOo in title bars, dialog box fields, sample filenames, or whatever.  5) For screenshots, we recommend, but do not require, using the \"Ubuntu XP-Silver\" theme. A similar-looking theme on other platforms is okay.

Note, I only looked at the PDF.  The last page recommends that the user goes here for help: http://wiki.services.LibreOffice/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide  I see two issues with this. First, the link showed in the text does not exist. Second, if you look at the link associated with this text, it takes you to something other than what the text states, name, http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide. If LO has a site, then point to it. If LO does not have a site, then leave the OOo site. My guess is that this was simply a global text search and replace. [note to self, try to not do this, then I would look really silly]. Note, on closer inspection, at least four links have been incorrectly set by this. Oh, I see another in Table 1 on page 18.  I found the very last text a bit amusing for this chapter:  Printed and eBook materials The following books are available for download:  And then, nothing is listed. Just a wee bit amusing. Unclear what should go there, but, some of the previous links may be useful.  The screen shots showing OpenOffice.org macros rather than Libreoffice macros in screen shots of the macro organizer are probably fine, but, they are wrong. Lots of work to fix those... One example is Figure 6.  A glaring omission in the document is that it does not mention that LO requires that recording macros must be enabled (Tools > Options > LibreOffice > General and then check \"Enable experimental (unstable) features). That is not required in OOo.  Any idea when the extensions library for LO will be online? It is referenced, but it takes you to a WIKI.

I'm a bit baffled by the database engines that present themselves to the world bare. Apparently one just writes one's own interface for them, yes?

I know a lot of people that don't want to use OpenOffice or LibreOffice because Base don't supply their needs, they can't port ther MS Access databases directly, but the situation is worse: they can't make (from scratch) new databases in a easy way with Base, while yes with MS Access.  A lot of people don't know a lot of programming, but knows the minimum to create consistent databases with this type of software, and this same people don't want to pay another developer to make specific software with a lot of different technologies groupped together (mysql, and maybe qt, or gtk, or a web frontend made in php....). In little business, the people can't waste their time creating \"perfect\" information management systems, many times they have 1 only computer and it's a critical point the ability to make backups of the database copying one single file in a usb pendrive in one or two steps.  Sometimes seems that TDF forgets these people, I've read months ago something like \"that can be done with... [here you should write a pipeline of chained applications, more than 4], it's a waste of time doing this software (a program I propposed)\".

What is currently available is the manuscript of the lessons ported for LibreOffice and the lesson files that accompany these chapters / tutorials.  There are a total of 9 tutorials currently available suitable for individual learners as well as for use in academic environments.  There are tutorials / lessons for use with Writer, Calc, Impress and Base.  Please note that the manuscript files do not contain screenshots; they are simply .odt text files of the chapters themselves.  The primary purpose of the manuscript files are to make it easier for making adaptations, native language translations and/or incorporation into other works.  I am currently trying to work on taking these manuscript files and importing them into the LibreOffice Documentation chapter templates, as well as adding the screenshots, so that they reflect the current format used for the Users Guides.

Regards from Tom :)      ________________________________ From: \"Gurley, Gabriel\"  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org Subject: [libreoffice-documentation] New Tutorials, Manuscript Now Available  Hi everyone,  As a follow-up to my message last Thursday, I have now uploaded a draft copy of  the manuscript and lesson files for the Conceptual Guides port for LibreOffice.   You can find these files in the following location within the Alfresco site  repository:  English Content | Documentation | Tutorials &amp; How-tos | A Conceptual Guide to  LibreOffice Learning Series.  What is currently available is the manuscript of the lessons ported for  LibreOffice and the lesson files that accompany these chapters / tutorials.   There are a total of 9 tutorials currently available suitable for individual  learners as well as for use in academic environments.  There are tutorials /  lessons for use with Writer, Calc, Impress and Base.  Please note that the manuscript files do not contain screenshots; they are  simply .odt text files of the chapters themselves.  The primary purpose of the  manuscript files are to make it easier for making adaptations, native language  translations and/or incorporation into other works.  I am currently trying to work on taking these manuscript files and importing  them into the LibreOffice Documentation chapter templates, as well as adding the  screenshots, so that they reflect the current format used for the Users Guides.   As these are completed, I will be adding them to the repository in the same  location noted above.  Hope these resources will be of benefit.  As always, feel free to notify me of  any issues with the documentation and related resources, as well as any  improvements you think can be made to them.  Best regards, Gabriel Gurley   "

        "text": "  For all practical purposes, the database component of OOo was treated like the red haired stepchild. Under the TDF, LibO has simply continued that mistreatment.   When the discussion about which _additional_ database engine OOo should include. HSQLDB won, and SQLite lost. From my POV,the only reason HSQLDB won, was because it used Java. At the time, it was technically inferior to SQLite.  In an ideal world, there would be an extension that installs SQLite as if it were built into LibO, and provide a usable UI for database creation, editing, and viewing.   This relates to who creates databases.  There is a lot of useful theory, and practice in database construction and maintenance. For most projects, applying that theory would be helpful. Which is why database designers are very reluctant to allow non-database designers to create databases.  Or, more bluntly, don't like pre-built tools that non-database designers can use, to create, and use databases.  The simple reality is that when there is not an obvious, easy way to construct a database, people will use spreadsheets, blithely ignoring the fact that spreadsheets can, and will destroy their data. Then, since most people use spreadsheets instead of databases, development of database tools for Joe Sixpack gets lowered in priority, eventually reaching the point that databases for mortals are considered irrelevant.  this, what else is there in the opensource world?  PERL, Python, Ruby, etc.  world bare. Apparently one just writes one's own interface for them,  Historically, database engines have shipped without an interface. The user was expected to write their own UI. This presents the fewest restrictions on the database designer.  By way of example: I create resources for various Bible study programs.  These all use databases for the content. With a generic UI, I can't force record 31102 to be Revelation 22:21, or validate Vulgate versification as it is entered. With a custom UI, Vulgate versification can be input, and the data automatically converted to KJVA versification.   Database designers are the last hold out in the IT World, thinking that they are gods, and nobody else is pure enough to do what they do.  All that said, I do think that a manual that focuses on using the Base component as a front end to PosgreSQL, MySQL, Mariadb, Drizzle, MS Access, etc. A second manual, focusing exclusively on SQLite might be justified.  jonathon "

And...go forward on my own with Ruby/sqlite project, constructing the sort of kludgy-but-very-functional commandline interface I've already done with my personal entity/relationship db experiments. Primitive, but damn well works, and not dependent upon anything I can't count on. The key to is constructing a domain specific language (easy with ruby), reserving direct SQL access for rarely encountered needs (as is normally done), and do output and input via text files. No pretty GUI, but real results for sure. I can live with this, AND it just might be useful to other people.  Sad what you say about the database design community, but all too true.

To use any database well requires more design and knowledge than simply slapping together a spreadsheet. A good database design must answer several design questions, very similar to software design. Essentially, a well designed database models logical groupings and the relationships between the groups within the data thus making easier to maintain and access.   SQL is not particularly hard to learn if you have some programming experience but difficult for non-programmers. Queries are often very straight forward but SQL requires accurate obedience to its syntax rules much like a programming language. "

        "text": "Hi,  2011/8/5 planas   My experience: Not only spreadsheds are used by unexperienced people, even when they don't know SQL. An example: my fathers (mother and father) learned to use MS Access many years ago (arount 15 years), and designed many databases for friends and other people (as a \"job\", they earned money). Their first databases were .. hummmm... crap, but, hey!, those databases were better than the older software of their clients! O_O , they learned VB macros slowly, and making a lot of crappy designs (today they only know a very little subset of SQL). Well, at this moment I know a minimum of three databases made by they that are still running today, In my opinion these three databases are the worst crap i ever saw, but their users are happy with them -_- , happier than if they had to use only spreadsheeds, because their needs are too complex for only using spreadsheeds.  More examples? My best friend started to work in Seat (a spanish automotion company, part of WV), in theory as a junior mechanic engineer... but, wow!, his boss ordered him to make a MS Access database ... he didn't know anything about database design, but he could do the job in a reasonable time (ok, it was the BIGGEST CRAP i saw in my life, but worked... another time). In Seat they don't use LibreOffice or OpenOffice because Base is not really usable while MS Access, even if it's horrible, is working as they expect.  More: In the Faculty of Economics and Bussiness of the University of Barcelona... the same, they don't use LibreOffice or OpenOffice because they are tied to MS Access (and... uff, to SAP :s ) ... (they have a \"hole\" of 45 millions of euros, they don't like to pay for licenses, they pay because it's their \"only\" option... they don't know any other way of doing the work). In this case... I'm working to break many of these dependencies, I'm working on an online platform (with PHP and MySQL) to manage many of their crappy issues, but I'm only a scholarship holder in a little department.  Even if you don't believe it, people will learn to design databases without knowing theory if they have to do a lot of databases, and this (little) practical knowdlege may be the difference between having to pay a lot of money to an external developer or having the possibility to solve the problems without external help.  Why I think it's important Base? because it's potential integration with Writter and Calc , because when it's needed to make reports, and graphs, it's possible to export them as ODF documents, or to \"print\" them as PDF files... that's not a \"trivial\" task with other software stacks. And because the familiarity of users with \"old\" tools as MS Access, and the possibility to work without servers, and moving the data between computers using a single file (in many cases, I know that it's not true all the time).

Sorry to be a bother, but I do not know my way around well, and, I could not find the document that tells me how things should look, and, I do not want to change things if I am not sure that they should be done. So, where is the \"do it this way\" documentation? I am sorry for all the questions, but, this is my first LO document so I assume that the documents are as they should be and that everyone knows more than I.  For example:  QUESTION: A newly inserted figure (that is nicely done, by the way), does NOT contain a caption and is not in a frame. My instinct is to add a caption and place the figure in a frame, because it looks like this is true for all other figures. My assumption is that either (1) there is a reason this does not need to be done like the others, (2) Martin forgot, (3) Martin did not know better, or, the most likely yet, (4) Martin did everything perfectly, and Jean pulled it out and removed the caption to test me :-)  QUESTION: With OpenOffice.org, I always wrote OOo. For LibreOffice, should I use LibO rather than LO?  QUESTION: In the document, I found new text that reads similar to:  click Tools  Options  LibreOffice  General and tick the box Enable experimental (unstable) features.  I expected to see:  use Tools  Options  LibreOffice  General and tick the box Enable experimental (unstable) features.  If I wanted Italics, I expected to use the  style.    COMMENTS FOR MARTIN:  Martin, your new figures look great and it seems that you paid good attention to detail. I will change wording where it is not sufficiently precise; for example, when you state that the \"Writer Library\" is selected, it is really the Writer Module in the Martin Library. Without checking, my guess is that I introduced this error in the original.   "

You need to clone the 'help' repository, and edit there:  git clone http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/help  Ideally using a normal text editor (Vim, Emacs, ...), and committing to git.  Unfortunately this is not as easy as editing the wiki pages; that's why all this wikihelp project has started :-)  Currently there is a Google Summer of Code student working on this (with me mentoring).  Unfortunately the switch cannot happen before the wikihelp -> native help convertor is finished, and works really well :-(   This document describes how to work with .xhp files:  http://documentation.openoffice.org/online_help/OOo2HelpAuthoring.pdf  But unfortunately it is not too convenient; and I have no idea how much has that changed since it was written (but the basic concepts are still valid).    Might be best to appear on the #libreoffice-dev mailing list, we'll help you there with git to get the most recent help, and with the .xhp files editing :-)  Thank you a lot, Kendy   "

Differences between it and the 3.3 template are small, but I thought it was best to create a new one instead of changing the old one... which could cause disruption if/when existing 3.3 chapters are updated to correct errors.  The main differences in the 3.4 template are the new or expanded explanations written by Gary and me and some reorganization of content. The explanatory text still needs improvement.  The template's explanatory content has been copied into a new chapter of the Contributors' Guide, titled \"Using the LibreOffice Chapter Template\". This chapter could probably benefit from some reworking.  The new chapter should be read in conjunction with the chapter on \"Producing LibreOffice User Guides\". There is some overlap, but mostly they are intended to supplement each other. You may find some inconsistencies between the two documents, because I have not had time to go through the \"Producing\" chapter to bring it up to date with the \"Template\" chapter. I also put the two files on the wiki.  I'll be away for the rest of the week, with intermittent email access and no opportunity to upload or download files.  --Jean   "

The Installing_extensions.odt document, in fact, is a merge of my new content with the previous document of Andreas (based on the extensions section of 0109GS3-SettingUpAndCustomizing.odt).    The document is here:    http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/File:Installing_extensions.odt (I removed the date on the name).    For this document, first of all, I suggest a review for correct English spelling and grammar, and improve any part of content, if it is necessary . The extension installation process is very simple to do, then, I think someone with good English can review it easily.    After review, Andreas can put a link to a PDF version of this document from the every extension page on the site.    Additionally, we can include the content of Installing_extensions.odt in the extensions section of 0109GS3-SettingUpAndCustomizing.odt or keep it as a different document. Sincerely, I don't know what is the better way. You can feel free for do it. :)    For the Publishing_extensions.odt document, there is a more complex review process. I agree with many comments of you: perhaps http://extensions-test.libreoffice.org can be modified or not. I have tested it many times and I think it needs only a few adjusts to be ready (Andreas has done a great job!). Because this, Publishing_extensions.odt is indeed a work in progress.    The document is here:   http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/File:Publishing_extensions.odt   (I removed the date on the name and I cropped the browse images in this version by suggestion of Jean,).    I think there are two ways for Publishing_extensions.odt.    A first way is to ask another extension(s) developer(s) to test the step-by-step of publishing a project on the website. After his vacation, Andreas can help us to find someone and can contribute with some comments himself. Then, I can update the document with the people comments. After, I will inform here about the moment to do an English spelling and grammar review.    A second possible way is more simple: someone do a English review now, Andreas put the document in the extensions website and we wait for comments by the developers.    In both ways, I wish to wait Andreas opinion.   Regards,  Gustavo Pacheco.      2011/8/13 Rainer Bielefeld    "

But I still miss at least a little bit of discussion on macros - at least how to record them, and maybe the kind of service they can render. Already Chapter 9 alludes to them in \"Assigning macros to events\" - how do we work that in without talking about how to create them in the first place? However, it is probably true that almost no beginners use them. Maybe a short appendix at the end on how to record them, with a cross-reference to in-depth coverage elsewhere?  I miss coverage of Base, but it's also true that Base is a tool that is difficult to cover in a \"quick, beginner guide\", because one quickly gets into complex explanations. How about a small section at least discussing the possible uses of Base integration in the other LibO components?  Maybe some similar coverage of Math, too?  So those are three possible alterations one could make.  Those points aside, your plan looks really good.   The plan looks good, but I might suggest putting the two parts - the \"more-elementary\" coverage and the so-to-speak \"advanced topics\" - inside one volume. That way, people with more commonplace needs get their info without having to wade through extraneous stuff, while people looking to do more sophisticated things can still find the information in one place without needing several books/PDFs open at the same time.  In the advanced section, I'd like to see at least some coverage of Math and how easy it is to insert equations. Same thing for Base integration. Same thing for drawings (as a complement to the spreadsheet coverage).  As you yourself have mentioned before in previous threads, and I whole-heartedly agree, Writer/Web really sucks as a means for producing Web pages. I couldn't imagine myself recommending someone to do it that way. In the context of the many other means of easy Web publishing available these days, I reckon it's almost an obsolete feature in its current implementation. I wouldn't give it much coverage except insofar as not to leave a blank hole in our documentation about the related menu items in the software.  But, basically, your ideas sound very good and probably cater more closely to users' real needs than the current material. In any case, I'm sure you're unlikely to overlook coverage of any important subject *somewhere* in the LibreOffice documentation, so I'd be happy to go with your ideas and assist you in developing them progressively.

Hey, it is the same news..... It  works for me and looks fine.  I do take exception to a few items that were done while converting this from OOo  to LO (as it were); and perhaps a few dumb things that I may have done, but, I  won't bother to go back and check. Note, I only looked at the PDF.  The last page recommends that the user goes here for help: http://wiki.services.LibreOffice/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide  I see two issues with this. First, the link showed in the text does not exist.  Second, if you look at the link associated with this text, it takes you to  something other than what the text states, name,  http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide. If LO has a  site, then point to it. If LO does not have a site, then leave the OOo site. My  guess is that this was simply a global text search and replace. [note to self,  try to not do this, then I would look really silly]. Note, on closer inspection,  at least four links have been incorrectly set by this. Oh, I see another in  Table 1 on page 18.  I found the very last text a bit amusing for this chapter:  Printed and eBook materials The following books are available for download:  And then, nothing is listed. Just a wee bit amusing. Unclear what should go  there, but, some of the previous links may be useful.  The screen shots showing OpenOffice.org macros rather than Libreoffice macros in  screen shots of the macro organizer are probably fine, but, they are wrong. Lots  of work to fix those... One example is Figure 6.  A glaring omission in the document is that it does not mention that LO requires  that recording macros must be enabled (Tools > Options > LibreOffice > General  and then check \"Enable experimental (unstable) features). That is not required  in OOo.  Any idea when the extensions library for LO will be online? It is referenced,  but it takes you to a WIKI.

In all  cases the screen-shots were clear, easy to read and good quality.  Nothing  screamed MS, all seemed to be on Gnu&amp;Linux and i didn't notice anything saying  OpenOffice.     Screen-shots that still have a blue title-bar are in  Ch 3   p 8 (2nd image), 9 Ch 6   p 4, 5, 8, 9, 16, 19,  Ch 9   p 5, 12 &amp; 13  Ch10  p 5, 6, 13 but only 2 of those might be less easy to read as a result Ch 6   p  4 Ch10  p13  but even there it was not too bad and looked fine imo.     In 4 of those Chapters it might be easier just to replace the Silver themed  screen-shots to make the chapters consistent in themselves even if that makes  them inconsistent with the rest of the guide(s).  So the silver screen-shots in  those were in Ch 4  p14 Ch 5  p11 Ch 6  p 6, 12, 23  Ch10 p16, 25    A couple of oddities i noticed were a couple of menu selection list backgrounds  but in both cases it looked quite nice and went well (or contrasted nicely) with  the other colours in the example.    Ch 4  p15 blue  Ch 5  p 7  purple    If there ever was a problem it has either been fixed or worried about too much.

        "text": "We have discussed my proposed reorganization of the book, but given the amount of work (both writing and reviewing) that would be involved to do a good job) I think it is better to simply update the existing set of chapters for V3.4 at this time.  Therefore I have put a set of Getting Started files on Alfresco in English Content > Documentation > Getting Started > Drafts V3.4.x  Below is my list of what needs to be done to update to V3.4, plus some minor improvements (that could be skipped). These are collected here: http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development#Getting_Started_Guide  Similar lists for the other books are coming soon.  --Jean  GETTING STARTED GUIDE: Updates for LibO V3.4.x =====================  General: check screenshots for changes. Use silver/gray theme for any replacements needed. In many cases (Chapter 4,5,6,7) the component guide will contain a newer image that can be used in this book without necessity of recapturing/redoing.   On copyright page of each chapter: * Use \"data table\" coloring style for the table of Mac usage info. * Change LibO version number and publication date.  Chapter 1 (Intro)  * Verify system requirements and all URLs. * Passwords can now be changed while document is open; add to section on password protecting a doc.  Chapter 2 (Setup)  * Internationalized font previews: Fonts which are tuned for use with a specific script, e.g. Arabic, Hebrew, Malayalam, etc. now show an additional preview of some sample text in the target script. Mention in Setup bit on font preview  Chapter 3 (Styles &amp; Templates)  * Mention that manual (\"direct\") formatting over-rides styles, and how to remove it.  Chapter 4 (Writer)  * Find toolbar: revise info * Add brief info on Paragraph and Character *style* dialogs to reinforce message that styles are preferred to manual formatting. * Mention that manual (\"direct\") formatting over-rides styles, and how to remove it. * Slightly amend info on View Layout to say that the effect varies with zoom and window width.  Chapter 5 (Calc)  * Redesigned Move/Copy Sheet dialog (Edit->Sheet->Move/Copy) - put in section on \"working with sheets\". * Add a few words on sheet tab colors (get words from Calc Guide). * Add a few words on total and subtotals? * Mention Pivot Tables (formerly DataPilot) and refer reader to Calc Guide. * Add a few words on functions and formulas, refer reader to Calc Guide.  Chapter 6 (Impress)  * Especially check this chapter for visual differences in the user interface. * \"Media clip\" is now \"Movie\" (especially in screenshots). * Add reference to bundled Presenter Console extension.  Chapter 7 (Draw)  * Curves toolbar is shown twice; second instance is redundant - remove it. * Use new pix from Draw Guide in several places.  Chapter 8 (Base)  * Needs to be checked for accuracy, in case something has changed. Somewhere I have a note with info on one error; I'll find it.  Chapter 9 (Math)  * Add reference to Math Guide &amp; the tables of info in it.  Chapter 11 (Graphics)  * Replace Imagemap dialog picture with one from Writer Guide.  Chapter 14 (Customizing)  * Color Charts: Adding and Removing color charts is now possible from Tools->Options->Charts->Default Colors. There is nothing about Chart colors in the book, and I think it fits better under \"Customizing\" (Ch 14) than it does under \"Setup\" (Ch 2).    "

Based on the feedback from Andreas Mantke and your draft, I've drafted  this one - thoughts welcome!  == LibreOffice launches extension and templates repository for public beta test  Developers invited to contribute their addons Community-based review process ensures quality and reliability  LibreOffice, the free office productivity suite, can be enhanced with hundreds  of extensions and templates. Users can download these smart extras to improve  the suite's functionality to fit their job or hobby, and developers can easily  write their own add-ons and share it with millions of users worldwide.  Since at the moment there is no reliable and stable source for downloading these  handy add-ons, the LibreOffice community has put great efforts into launching a  public repository. It does not only provide extensions and templates for  LibreOffice, but also for OpenOffice.org and other compatible office suites.  Users of these can benefit from the work and the commitment of our community,  and are invited to have a look at recent versions of our product, which already  has included has the most popular extensions, and comes with many new features.  The new site is now in public beta testing at  http://extensions-test.libreoffice.org and has been created in cooperation with  the Plone community, on whose technology it is based. To ensure the quality and  reliability of the offered extensions, a community-based review process is  currently set in place: Community volunteers test and review available  extensions, and those meeting criteria of quality will be tagged accordingly.  We warmly invite all developers to submit their extensions and fill the  repository, where millions of users worldwide will be able to download and  benefit from their work. All extensions submitted during the public beta test  will remain in the repository after the beta test, so this is your chance to  join the efforts right from the beginning! ==  Florian  "

Therefore the Help that comes with Alfresco isn't going to be much help; best to ignore it.  David Nelson is still working on the customisation, so the chapter on \"Using LO's Alfresco website\" is out of date in some places and unlikely to be updated until David has reached a stable point in the customisation.  So... at this time we are using this user interface to Alfresco: http://documentation.libreoffice.org/ NOT alfresco.libreoffice.org. The instructions in \"Using LO's Alfresco website\" are accurate for most of that user interface. (I will update that line in the document now, because that is the single most misleading statement in the existing document.)  When using that interface, the instructions for editing offline show the row of icons that appear under the document (on the other interface, the icons are off to the right-hand side). The first icon (Edit Offline) locks the file (to show others that it is being worked on) and creates a working copy for you to download and edit.  The statement about putting your \"wiki user id\" (whatever that is!) in the \"checkout\" column\" refers to a page on the wiki, not on Alfresco (similar to OOo's task list page). So far, I don't think anyone is actually using that LO wiki page to track work.  Hope this helps, and sorry about the confusing instructions.

I'll be addressing the problem as soon as possible. Meanwhile, do feel free to ask any questions here on the list, and I'll respond as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.  @Jean: I'm busy on a client project for the next 10 days to come, and I'm also waiting for mail back about the 2 key problems with the Share interface: inability to use accented characters in folder names, and a curious problem with uploading .odt files that has emerged recently (it *would* have to be .odt files rather than any other format... there's no problem uploading PDFs, and it's only in the English content space, not any of the other ones). The upgrade did not fix those problems.  If I don't find rapid solutions to the aforesaid issues, maybe it would be pragmatic to side-step them and simple work with the Explorer interface (http://documentation.libreoffice.org), which has no such problems. That way, I can give a green light to Jeremy to re-implement the workflow described in his original guide, and we can update the contributor documentation quickly.  After that, the other problem I'm wrestling with is configuring the Drupal installation at http://media.libreoffice.org to interact with Alfresco, so that we get a public no-login showcase for the content on Alfresco.  As soon as I've dealt with the above, I'll be available to work on documentation - starting with the Power User Guide to be developed from the existing technical writer's guide contributed by those students.  I'll be following up on my last unanswered mail to my mentor this weekend. I'll mail back to the list with news as soon as possible - certainly sometime within the next 2 weeks.

I may be giving you more than you need, but maybe the documentation folks can make use of this in some way too.   - Dennis   1. FINAL SHOWING MARKUP  \"Final Showing Markup\" is a Track Changes option in Microsoft Office.  (The other options are Original, Original Showing Markup, and Final).  Final Showing Markup appears to be the default setting.  \"Final Showing Markup\" shows how the document will appear when all changes are accepted, and what the changes are that leave it in that shape.  This option has been available in all versions of Microsoft Word *since* Office 2000.  What that means, when using Word, is that insertions are marked by underlining but that deletions don't show in the text.  Instead, deletion points are linked to balloons in the margin that show what was deleted.  (In case you were wondering, Original Showing Markup has the insertions in marginal balloons and deletions are strikeouts in the text.)  There is a description of this at  http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/sharing/howtousethereviewingtoolbar.html>.   2. IN-LINE ONLY CHANGES - ALL THAT LIBREOFFICE HAS  In Microsoft Office, there is also a kind of tracked-changes presentation where both insertions (colored and underlined usually) and deletions (different color, with strikethrough usually) are all in the running text.  This is accomplished by turning off the balloon feature.  In Libre Office, this is the *only* way that tracked changes can be shown.  If you look at Tools | Options | LibreOffice Writer | Changes you will see what is under your control.   3. THE GOOD NEWS    3.1 If, with the final draft you are being asked to review, set the Changes options to something your editor is asking to see, such as Insertions Underlined and in Light Blue color.  Deletions with Strikethrough and Red color.  Changed attributes Underlined Double and Color Magenta 4 or so.  I don't know if he wants to see change marks, but you can leave them on the left margin and black.    3.2 IN FACT, these setting apply to the software being used to view the document.  The settings don't travel with the document.  A reviewer will see their settings applied as if that is what you used.  You do have to turn on Record and Show in the Edit | Changes ... menu though.    3.3 IF YOU ARE LUCKY, your editor will open the document for Review with Final Showing Markup and will see exactly what is being expected.  You might warn the editor that the setting might have to be selected after opening the document in Word.   4. THE BAD NEWS    4.1 I don't know if you have been turning back change-marked documents, or receiving change-marked documents.  If you have, you probably know how careful you have to be.    4.2 To put it politely, interoperability of change-tracking across formats is not terrific.  Extensive changes and rearrangements can be messed up something also when there is a conversion between formats.    4.3 CAREFUL, SMALL STEPS SHOULD WORK.  I assume your manuscript is not complex.  So long as you are down to correcting typos and short wordings, you should be fine.  Instead of making a change between two paragraphs or across other mixes of materials (list items, text flowing across images, table rows), keep the changes small.  Make multiple small changes, rather than big ones that span units of text.  This works best if your document is not done against an exotic template and has rich features as well as text.    4.4 CONFIRM IF YOU CAN.  If you have a Word viewer, you might be able to see if the change-tracking goes across all right.  If saving as .doc and then reopening it in LibreOffice looks fine, you are probably all right too.  (But you might still be all right but unable to confirm it if round trip to .doc and back into LibreOffice deviates in some way.)    -----Original Message---"

Errors and Suggestions for LibreOffice Writer Guide.  /Page 57./ To match the screen-shot, the last sentence of the text above Figure 58 ought to read ... In the example, English (Australia) has been chosen for all the appropriate settings except User Interface..  /Page 195./ The third line of the fourth paragraph reads For example, if you decide that all the headings should be blue (such as in this guide), you only . The word 'blue' should be replaced with the word 'green', as all headings are green.  /Page 290./ The text of step 8 should match the screen-shot in Fig. 303 (as it does in the OpenOffice.org Writer guide page 353 for its Fig. 295).  /Page 292./ Step 5 refers to a non-existent step 7. It is likely that the paragraph below Fig. 307 starting The document is now .. should be numbered as step 7.  /Page 293./ Fig. 307 screen-shot does not match the text, showing as it does ![Points.Sheet1.Last Name] instead of ![Points.Sheet1.Company] as in the text of step 6c. The text/screen-shot is also referred to on page 297, in step 4.  /Page 294./ Suggestion. The unnumbered screen-shot with a large black ellipse contained within, appears unnecessary. The text within the paragraph appears to be adequate in describing what's present. In the event that a screen-shot is deemed necessary, then the large black ellipse surely is not required, given that only two choices are available.  /Page 296./ Step 6's last sentence is incorrect and should read ;otherwise continue with Removing blank lines from labels.  /Page 297./ The '*Caution*' should read step 3) not step c).  /Page 298./ In the 'Printing' section, step 3's 4^th paragraph should be 6 and not 6f.  /Page 299./ The /*TIP */is wrong. Both the Addressee and Sender dimensions can be altered in their Position boxes. Clicking the *New Doc. *Button with the dimensions shown**in the screen-shot shown below produces an envelope document with the fields placed as directed. Has the screen-shot for Fig. 313 been taken from OpenOffice.org Writer? A bug(?) in their Writer prevents the fields in the envelope layout being seen, though I believe it's been rectified for their next release. LibreOffice shows it correctly as shown below. I suggest the screen-shot is replaced with a LibreOffice screen-shot.    /Page 300./  I think step 4's second paragraph should read and dropping, /*then*/click..., and not and dropping, /*than*/click ....  /Suggestion/. Redo paragraphs 4 and 5 as below. This change brings the setting of the Sender box to a point before the setting of the Addressee fields, particularly for anyone being directed off to drag and drop.  4) Select the *Envelope *tab. (Fig 315 inserted here). Choose whether or not to add Sender information to the envelope by selecting or deselecting the Sender check-box. If wanted, edit the information in the Sender box (Sender is the fromon the envelope). You now have the choice of creating the Addressee fields by dragging and dropping from the data source headings (as described in Creating a form letter on page 291, and in particular in Figure 305) or using the facilities of this tab.  If you prefer dragging and dropping, then click *New Doc.*, drag your data source headings into the Addressee area on your new envelope and skip to step 7), otherwise continue with steps 5 and 6.   5) Verify, add, or edit the information in the Addressee box. You can use the right-hand drop-down lists to select the database and table from which you can access the Addressee information, in a similar fashion to that described for Printing mailing labels, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 on page 295. The similarity of the method with Figure 311 and Figure 312 will be clear..  /Page 301./ /Suggestion. Step/ 6's third paragraph to read as follows.  You can now further modify the placement and size of the frames containing the sender(if inserted) and addressee information, or make further changes to the character and paragraph attributes (for example, the font) or add a logo or other graphic to the envelope. Modify the frame by first clicking on the frame's boundary; modify its size by clicking on and dragging the green handles; change its position by clicking and dragging from within the frame's boundaries..  The /*TIP */within step 7 ought to reclassified as a /*NOTE */as it only explains why the following text is there and points out a similarity with another section.  /Error?. /Step 7 c). At the end of the first sentence, change 'label' to 'envelope'. In the second sentence, add the word 'character' between 'line' and 'and' thus; the new line /character /and then press ....  /Page 302./ Paragraph 3 of /*Merging and printing the envelopes. */The following text is wrong. If you wish to check the envelopes before printing them, see Step 9 of Creating a form letter on page 291 for instructions.. This step does not exist. I suggest replacing it with  If you wish to check the envelopes before printing them, see Editing merged documents on page 294 for instructions.  /Page 310./ Step 7's first sentence ought to read Step 7 creates all your letters, one per recipient. instead of In step 7, creates all your letters, one per recipient..

The linux version has a name something like java-1.6.0_21 The _20 that is in some distros repos is fine, not quite as good but good  enough.  Likewise the _22 is ok too.  The _23 seems to be slow and causes  problems for some people while the _24 and onwards seem to cause a lot of  problems even crashing LibreOffice for some people.     Oracle are developing java which i find interesting.  OpenJDK, which is  recommended in the release notes for LibreOffice, seems to cause a few problems  for people and i think it's just not as highly developed, yet.  I'm sure it will  get there and the coding is probably a lot more elegant and secure given the  nature of these projects.     I think people will need to have 2 versions of java; one for their web-browser  and one for LibreOffice until the code clean-up has removed any dependence on  java.     I don't know if there is documentation about how to install 2 versions of java,  or if it's easy or if documentation refers to versions of java somewhere.  Would  be a good plan to mirror the java that Tim has uploaded to make sure it is still  accessible for LibreOffice users?

        "text": "Hi Barry On Linux the location of installed programs can vary widely. Many are put into /usr/bin. If you compile from source often the prefix will be /usr/local/bin. In \"olden\" times it was normal that /opt was the location of \"optional programs.  Have a look at http://slashmedia.wordpress.com/2007/12/23/linux-directory-structure/ or google around a bit and you will find the history of the unix folder structure.  But OOo and LibO have used /opt as the top level folder for all builds which have come from the organisations themselves.  The problem comes when you have installed a customised version of one of these packages. I mean customised by Canonical/OpenSuSE etc. Then the folder in which it may be found can and does differ from the \"original\".  That is what you have found out! :=)  You can install other versions of the program to use a more up to date build, and it will (if downloaded from the OOo/LibO site) install into the /opt folder. If it is a stable build it will go into (for example) /opt/openoffice.org or /opt/libreoffice3.4. If a pre release build it probably ends up in /opt/ooo-dev or /opt/lo-dev.  It is quite feasible to have multiple versions of the programs installed. I have LO3.4 and 3.4m1 daily build as well as OOo 3.4beta on my laptop. Running different versions concurrently can be a bit tricky.  The other gotcha is the association of file extensions. Your originally installed version in /user/lib/.... will probably be the version opened if you double click an odt file.  It is relatively simple to change these file associations if you want.  Adding additional menu entries is often not necessary if you have installed the -kde-integration or -gnome-integration packages. Of course this is a generalisation and all generalisations are false.  Feel free to shout on this list if you need more help, there are plenty of people \"lurking\", and most of the Linux power users are much better qualified than me to give advice.  regards Martin  Barry Smith  wrote:    "

The previously-existing problems have been resolved: it's now possible to use accented characters in folder names under Share, and there is now no problem uploading .odt files under Share.  My plan is to manually copy across all our data from the existing Alfresco, so as not to accidentally migrate the previously-existing problems. I'll be posting back about that before proceeding, so as to negotiate a freeze on work for a 24-hour period.

I have been active with Free &amp; Open Source Software for many years, written about it on writtenandread.net, used it professionally - it is part of my everyday life. I was proud to see myself on the list of http://www.documentfoundation.org/foundation/members/ because of my work with the Danish spellchecker project and being part of the Danish translation effort. I also did the Danish translation of Abiword and a number of smaller projects, and I was part of the Xfce translation team as well. I am joining this mailing list as part of my preparation to translate the documentation into Danish, starting with the Getting Started guide. On several occasions, I have come across people interested in doing something like 50-user deployments, but who end up backing away because no documentation is available in Danish. If there is a specific process and workflow, I hope that you will introduce me to it, and I will get started.

I am in the process of manually uploading all the previous content there. This is likely to be over this coming weekend. About 30% is done already. I have a backup on my local system in addition to one on the new server and a backup of the old server partition. I'll be restoring everything fairly much as it was on the old server, but taking account of a workflow that I have devised with Jeff Potts of the Alfresco project (more about that soon).  As soon as the data is restored, I'll be updating the contributor documentation so that people can get good guidance in using the Alfresco Share interface. It's much faster and more user-friendly than the old Explorer interface - especially since the new server is a 100%-dedicated machine with 8Gb of memory.  Good news is that the past problem of inability to browse folders with accented characters in the folder name has now been solved, so that localization teams will be able to make effective use of the new system.  In addition, I can install language packs so that many localization teams will be able to use the platform in their preferred language.  I have not yet migrated user accounts. Anyone who would like access before I do can post here to the list, and I will quickly create you an account and send you new credentials.  I'll write back with more news in a few days when I've done more work, but I'll that won't be before the weekend. Meanwhile, I'll be watching the list to deal with any account creation requests and any questions.  Anyone who wants documents posted on the new server is welcome to send them to me for the next few days, and I will be sure to post your content with the other stuff.

In many cultures it is impolite to criticise at all but in English and American culture you have to criticise quite rudely before anyone takes any notice. I think some of us are unclear whether you are saying that 1.  there definitely is a problem but you are naturally being polite and avoiding saying so or  2.  you have a vague feeling there might be a problem or 3. you don't think there is a problem but want to be prepared just in case there is one.   The copyright license of the books is a special one that allows modification and re-licensing. I think that if you do make changes, such as replacing the images then the new licence has to be the same type of license as the old one.   If you require it then it might be reasonably easy for David to set-up a new area for your project. Normally that is done for translations but i am fairly sure it could be done for your teacher's guides. That way you could work at getting higher resolution images for the screen-shots. Some people here might help with it and/or people involved with the teacher's guides locally?   I think on TDF lists you can happily be quite rude and say exactly what you need. We are all friends even those of us that appear to argue and disagree all the time.  Regards from Tom :)  -"

That would give us a good idea of whether the picture resolution needs to be improved or not. It would be a good for us to get feedback about that anyway.   Costs have to be covered somehow and a bit more to help cover unexpected problems and even make a little profit is fine too. Have a look at how much Lulu charge to get an idea of what you can do.  http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/getting-started-with-libreoffice-33/14703788 I think any extra money raised should go into your project there rather than back to TDF, unless you make millions! You wont need to buy the books frrom Lulu as your project is printing it's own and again that is fine so just set price according to what you feel is appropriate. I'm not sure how schools are funded there so it might not be possible for them to pay anything. If that is the case then it might be good to print the books showing a price but then allow the schools a reduction (to zero or whatever) so that if people want to buy additional books then they might be able to.    It does seem like an excellent and very worthwhile project. It is good to know that you are doing this :) Regards from Tom :)   -"

PDF to be sent to a commercial print shop would have 300 dpi for raster graphics (e.g., photos) and 1200 dpi for line art. Therefore, a typical screenshot would often appear fuzzy and have other faults in a printed book.

Now, all documents (.odt, .pdf, etc.) have proper thumbnails of the cover page, and can be fully previewed and read online without even having to download them. All meta data is displayable for each document and can be updated from the Alfresco interface (this includes renaming the actual files). The changes to meta data get written within the document.  There is also a simple workflow implemented for the documentation team, which I'll be documenting in the contributor docs.  Anyone who wants to start working on documentation can do so without problem. For the moment, I'd recommend liaising with me on this list before moving anything around - perhaps you can consider to be the team's librarian until such time as we have updated contributor docs and have \"finalized\" things.  All questions and comments are very, very welcome. There's lots of stuff that can be modified if you want.  Anyone who had an account on the old Alfresco platform will need a new account creating.

Other work we would have available would be rebranding documents and - optionally - replacement of screenshots. For this I could point you at various docs.  The rebranding work does not involve factual checking, just formatting basically. We have a guide that would explain the approach for that, Do you feel that might be within spec for you?  You could usefully have a look in the \"Repository> English> Documentation> Resources> Draft\" section and read the re-branding guide and the guide to producing documentation.

Obviously, the work you've done is a first pass in massaging the guide into a usable form for us.   This is a point that will need the above-mentioned technical validation. There are many filenames (and paths) that have not changed, even though the devs could easily have re-named them.

Someone accidentally used Crtl &amp; Enter a LOT of times and now wants to use find&amp;replace (or something) to get rid of them. I know \"\\\" is a normal enter but is there a character to mark Ctrl Enter? The thread in Nabble ... http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/Clear-all-quot-new-page-quot-td3372845.html  2. A Writer table. Some cells need to be \"checked\" (2 diagonal lines from corner-to-corner). Is there an elegant way of doing this easily? His inelegant example is here http://lot-et-garonne.chambagri.fr/LibreOfficeSample-CheckTableCell.odt The thread in Nabble http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/writer-How-to-check-a-whole-table-cell-td3313397.html  If you happen to know a simple answer to either of the above then great, please let me know. If it would take some digging around to find out then don't bother, it's really not  the Doc Team's job :)   More importantly please add your name to the Doc Team's wiki http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Teamwork unless you are shy. Also there is a wish-list of what people would like the Docs Team to do http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Production#Wish_List_for_User_Documentation and there si a beginning of a \"community Documentation\" section that could use a bit of tidying and adding to http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/HowTo  Screen-shots are generally to be taken in Gnu&amp;Linux, preferably Ubuntu, with a specific theme but since the wiki pages are easier to edit to remove 'wrong' images it's possibly ok to use screen-shots any which way you like. We want to try to keep the printable User Guides as reasonably consistent as possible but wiki pages don't matter so much. At least, that's my opinion.  I think it might be great if we could help Danishka do \"scalar vector graphics\" screen-shots to possibly replace the ones in the current guides but only for the books in his/her project for school/college books. Could we set-up somewhere in Alfresco or on the wiki to store all the updated svgs/eps? Would it be more appropriate to get the Design Team involved?   Thanks and regards from Tom :)  "

It would, of course, be an ideal solution to have .svg screenshots, but a tremendously-demanding job to produce them. I don't see that happening in the near future.

That might help us avoid falling behind if there are substantial changes. It would help if whatever documentation we link to is editable (like our wiki-pages rather than a blog) so that we could help there update there documentation a bit if something extreme happened. Perhaps give links to the \"community documentation\" provided by a couple of the major distros?

When I originally re-worked the Linux readme and the Linux installation instructions, I especially had in mind the idea of providing comprehensive instructions for inexpert users.  But covering Linux in such instructions is more complicated than other operating systems, because of the multiple distributions that need to be covered.  However, I have to admit that the resulting installation guides and the readme probably constitute as much of a barrier to easy installation for a newbie as the complexity (for a newbie) of a command-line installation process.  So a re-working is definitely necessary. What we currently have is rather \"spaghetti code-like\", especially after all the comments at the time were worked into the drafts.  "

I think that one might be best split into a few short sub-pages such as  Debian Ubuntu &amp; other Debian family distros Mageia / Mandriva and family Redhat family distros openSUSE distros Slackware Arch Many of those are probably about the same anyway.   On the main page something generic such as \"As Root User do ... \" and then later a \"Now as normal user ... \". I think the only differences between the distros is the file ending (either rpm or deb ie requires yum or dpkg or apt-get) and whether the distro has the \"sudo\" command by default to avoid needing to use \"su\" or logging in as Root.

I did finish a somewhat quick single-pass edit of Chapter 10, though but did not upload it to my website yet. The nags on the administration control panel on the phpBB3 forum site kept urging me to update to the latest version over the past several days, so I did that software updating first yesterday.  Chapter 10 had over 150 edits made to it. I suspect that the original source file from OOo was responsible for most, if not all, of those errors--not the rebranding efforts. The only LO-caused problem that I can remember was related to its not being updated for version 3.4 yet--a screenshot had a version 3.3 name for a dialog-box title. (Somebody should fix that, though...)  Because the OOo source file for Chapter 10 contained so many errors due to, perhaps, careless lapses, mostly with improper character formatting and manual overrides, I reckon that all of the remaining OOo Writer Guide chapter files used in rebranding might have been similarly \"contaminated.\"  I would prefer not having to perform all of those tedious copyediting repair jobs myself for those several other chapters, so maybe some volunteers might help out. No experience would be necessary, as I can readily instruct each and everybody in how to perform the copyediting and technical editing tasks that are necessary.  The edited chapter 10 (edit-tracked and commented) source file could be employed for giving general and specific instructions in how to carry out the many repetitious editing changes necessary in order to bring the LO chapter source files up to more-professional standards.  In any event, I will load the edited Chapter 10 source file onto my forum site soon and will include mucho exposition there also--relating to what was done in greater detail.   Gary    "

That is primarily why I will conduct it online on the forum site instead of having it buried under the rug and unused at LO docs or elsewhere.  I am on the OOo docs email list also as you, so we both clearly know that OOo docs is getting a fair number of recent volunteers--such as OOo getting a new volunteer right before I am posting this message, whereas LO is not receiving many such new volunteers, for what that is worth. OOo docs appears to be promoting itself much better effectively relative to LO docs--even though you have appealed to some new OOo volunteers recently over at OOo docs to entice them to come over to this side of the aisle also.  Anyway, I will continue to post the original (improperly edited) LO source file and the edited LO source file for Chapter 10 on the forum site and then add the exposition that indicates the specific areas of sloppiness and technical errors therein and how any technical-editor trainees, who might ever meander over there (from anywhere), should eradicate and remedy the errors.

Frankly, I'm wondering if they don't have some kind of spam thing going on over there. I've noticed regular posts from supposedly prospective docs contributors, but not one of them has ever posted back a second time, which is kind of strange. In the past, here on the LibO docs ML, when people volunteer then you usually see follow-up activity and some kind of work contribution thereafter.   If you're planning to do something that's \"in parallel\" to the LibO docs effort, insofar as you don't contribute work via LibreOffice resources, and yet you produce derived content in respect of what's offered by the LibO project, then you might at least want to bear in mind the question of LibO's copyright and logo usage rules.

So the perceived promotion is an historical artefact. Essentially all of the people who send notes to OOo doc are not subscribed, and presumably when they receive TJ's response they read the info he send them to, and they decide (for whatever reasons) that it's not what they want... at least not during the current uncertainty over the future of Apache OOo docs. So it's not a \"spam thing\" and I don't find it strange at all that people don't follow up.  That said, David is right: people who enquire here have been more likely to contribute, however briefly. I assume that's because things actually are happening here and people can perceive that, even if they are confused about what to do, where to start, and so on.  --Jean  "

(Both MS Word and FrameMaker still have numerous bugs remaining unfixed from well over a decade already, and newer bugs are continually being created.)  OOo would take eons in order to tackle many of their bugs, as newer bugs were likely piling up faster than their relatively few developers could fix them. LO seems to be a lot quicker. A case in point is LO's quick response to its first 3.4 release bug that would not handle edit tracking properly (where the copyedited deletions were not visible).  One problem with documentation when bugs are involved is that such documentation likely consists of workarounds--but these workarounds are not listed as being bug fixes. So, some documentation might not be accurate at some point in the future (or even needed) after any such bugs get fixed by the developers. IOW, the documents could contain much unnecessary (or possibly even nonfactual) material.  My take is that all documentation that involves known bug fixes should be disclosed as being bug fixes--even if doing that exposes the software suite to some criticism.  Gary    "

See the gap at the right-hand-side of http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Publications Smart eh?    Some people may continue to prefer to use the work-arounds given as part of the documentation for the 3.3.x branch even after a bug has been fixed in some cases.     If you really feel the need to identify which established ways of doing things are/were due to bugs and which are/were just an alternative way or even a main way of doing things then feel free.  I think Alfresco still has the folders ready for updating the older version of the documentation.  Personally i think it's better to keep moving forwards where possible rather than to back-track.    The OOo devs were often able to fix bugs and they submitted many patches and updates that had already been tested by the community but Sun often disdained to accept work done by non-employees (apparently).  That was part of the reason for forks such as Go-oo.  It was probably also part of the reason why so much was achieved so quickly with the code in early releases of LO when Go-oo and possibly others re-integrated with LO.  At least that's the impression i get after reading-up 3rd party accounts and hearing from a few disgruntled people that are much happier with LO under TDF than with anything under Sun.

Writers of documentation often include kludges to work around some bugs due to inadequate development of the software applications. No problem there, except... except when such kludges are not disclosed appropriately. When editing the Writer Guide starting in 2006, I might come across on occasion some esoteric empty paragraphs or extra spaces and some such in templates, master documents, or subdocuments--but at first I did not know just why they were there. They, in essence were temporary kludges included for workarounds to some OOo bugs--but there was little documentation, usually none, as to their purpose or even their existence.  The problem with employing kludges without documentation is that anybody having to maintain such templates, master documents, or subdocuments is most often not let into the \"secrets.\" One, much better way of employing documentation kludges is to append some very simple semi-permanent documentation that stays with the documents until the kludges are no longer needed (due to developers eventually fixing the code, etc.) and afterward they (both the kludge and its documentation) can be simply removed.  A simple manner of documenting a kludge would be to append a simple comment (Insert > Comment) to that segment of the document and simply keep it there indefinitely--until it is no longer needed--after the kludge is removed, hopefully. OOo and LO documenters do not seem to do that... It was our fault as \"sloppy\" technical editors and writers not to adequately disclose such esoterics.  So, in everything that I do involving any such kludges, I will append simple documentation disclosure, so that any of my works can be easily and readily maintained by third parties. I recommend that LO documenters do likewise.  Gary   "

My point is that all such esoteric workarounds put into any document, template, or master document should be adequately disclosed, so that anybody maintaining or reviewing or editing those docs would know of their existence, their locations, their effects, their reasons for existence, and whether or not they are even needed any longer. If LO or OOo were to use any such mysterious kludges in the future, they should be appropriately documented. OOo (and LO) rarely ever disclosed their former kludges in a clear, consistent manner. That's all to my point.  The only good reason that a workaround would have been used in the past was to act as a temporary band-aid approach due to a bug being present. Bugs generally get fixed, so after the bugs are fixed, the kludges should be eliminated in favor of better writing or editing practices.  Gary    "

        "text": "One would surely not be aware of any if they were not disclosed, now would they?  Well, Jean was the most likely editor who used them at OOoAuthors in order to get around a number of deficiencies with the master documents, mostly. The rub was that she rarely, if ever, disclosed them--unless somebody might tamper (remove) them inadvertently without realizing that they were \"features\" installed for some workaround or another.. Then, Jean might state that such-and-such was there for some workaround and that it should be left intact.  Other locations for some kludges might be on the title pages of the individual chapter files. Not disclosing them could \"break\" things, though, if other editors would work on such files without being aware of their presence.  A parallel in the computer-coding business is having a coder who might do things to enable \"job security.\" However, I am not including Jean into that kind of group. I was coming up with hints and suggestions for some future tutorials, and disclosing workarounds was just one of those suggestions. So, I brought it up here.  In any event, I am not against the use of kludges, as they often are the only way to accomplish some objectives with non-compliant applications--like the earlier versions of the quite buggy master documents in OOo. But, to be professional, those kludges really must be disclosed whenever they are employed.  'Nuff said... I came across a bit of obsolete material recently while technical editing the \"Working with Templates\" chapter. One subsection refers to installing the Template Changer, which is now preinstalled in LO. So, I remedied that. There is another area where a nonexistent command is documented. So, that subsection needs rewriting, as I left it for another volunteer to finish. Should be easy to finish, though. That chapter had not been modified at all in over eight months, so it needed work.  Perhaps, some volunteer writers who work with templates, like Jean and others, might add some input to that chapter, as she is writing a book on the subject, I think. I added some simple marginal notes in the chapter about some very minor ways to beef up the chapter. Also, a version 3.4 screen capture is needed. I will let others do the screenshots.  Another area is: writers who do not follow the formatting rules concerning paragraph and character styles in the template exposition. Using manual overrides (direct formatting) is a no-no.  Gary    "

TJ Frazier at OOo put some effort into it and, I believe, filed an issue. IMO it is probably related to the fact that many chapters began their lives as .swx files (OOo 1.x) and a few as .DOC files (from Word 97) rather than a bug in OOo or LO themselves.

Things were OK before, and I reckon you too resisted much of those changes for change's sake at LO docs.  Formatting that arrow was a nuisance anyway--having to use two character styles for each text/arrow combo.  I made an effort to turn off AutoCorrect in my editing as it tends to turn things like OOo into Ooo. One heading paragraph style in the version 3.3 template has such a paragraph style name--likely an AutoCorrected term that was not caught. (I included that suggestion in the tutorial.) Some page-style names in the earlier 3.3 template exposition had such AutoCorrect errors too, I think.  And I suppose you kept (in the template exposition) the addition about making sure that all writers, reviewers, and editors see that all the typefaces used in LO docs are installed on their computers, lest some inadvertent changes not be introduced by not having all the appropriate fonts installed.

Renaming the entire profile is a bit of a sledge-hammer approach, roughly equivalent to what most people expect from a re-install of the program, but it also works for sub-folders within the profile.    It's worth trying out the renaming and keep the lower-level folder open so that you can see the new \"3\" folder being created just by opening LO.    Often when people have problems with LO they can pin-point it to a specific file or sub-sub-folder within the user-profile and then simply revert to the factory default for that.   It works the same way in most other OpenSource programs.   Regards from Tom :)    -"

I know the German user mailing list is busy with preparing a German translation of the English Base user guide, but they have had to adapt/change quite a few bits because of the problems they encountered when using Base and when following the initial English getting started guide. I believe that Robert Grosskopf (regular Base user, bug reporter - at least on the German mailing lists) is heading up that translation effort, the aim, I think, is to post it to ODFAuthors once it is finished.

I guess it would help if I listed what I think those things are, and what I'm likely to do or not do, so we're all talking about the same thing.  Just one comment now: David Nelson said, \"If you feel that the team should continue to operate without any one single leader, with things being taken care of by the person most diligent at that moment...\"  My feeling is that things will have to continue to be \"taken care of by the person most diligent at that moment\" because no one person can (or, IMO, should) be directing all the traffic, and I'm certainly not going to hand out assignments or track everything that's going on. That's too much like a job, and I don't have time anyway.  Even with a \"team leader\" we need several people taking responsibility for specific topic areas, a luxury we've never had (and only had briefly, years ago, at OOo). We have a few, but not anywhere near enough.  I'll write more later.  --Jean  "

The team leader needs to have some helpers to whom some of responsibilities should be delegated. The helpers could do the work for each of their assigned areas and report to the team leader the results. Suggestions of what might work better could then be given by the team leader to the individual helpers.  Observation: It is very easy to reply \"+1\" to making a person the team leader to keep track of everything and everyone's progress. (Let someone else do it.) It is much harder to take on the responsibility of leading a specific topic area with persistence and diligence while only getting guidance from the team leader.  My experience with Jean's work goes back to OOo 1.1.x days. She does a wonderful job of guiding others. But she has had to do too many things for others that they were not willing to do for themselves. (She was the one to do the most important review of Getting Started with Base that someone else should have done.)  Maybe we need a need thread in which people volunteer to head the specific areas of LibreOffice. Perhaps this should be done first. Once we have leaders there, then might be a better time to have a team leader. After all, if we are truly a team, we ought to be doing our part.  These are my thoughts.  --Dan  "

        "text": "Hi :) Ahhh, it's actually a LOT easier than that.    1.  You just register a user-name and login for yourself, just as you would with registering at a forum.  It's less tricky than setting up an email account such as gmail or yahoo.  I think there might be a 24hour delay before you get the confirmation email to your address but that email should help you login for the first time and change your password to something simple and short.    Sadly the wiki doesn't seem to allow really complicated passwords so stick to letters and maybe numbers but no \"funny characters\".  Experiment with the password after you have got the first one sorted out.    Hmm actually this password stuff is the really messy, clunky and confusing bit and it is probably that which is making the whole thing seem like a nightmare.  I had to use the password \"password\" (which is the most common and most hacked/cracked password out there) for quite a while before i was able to find something better that i could use &amp; remember.    2.  Once you have an account and have logged in and are at the page you want to edit it's much like just writing an email.  Once you have written what you want scroll down past all the language options, write a brief comment in the equivalent of the subject-line and click the appropriate button to \"submit\" changes.  The preview button can be a bit confusing at first so don't bother using it until you have made a few successful changes to a page.    3.  It is possible to use a type of mark-up language that does quite a few things that html would do but uses a different language called wiki-mark-up.  If you are fairly familiar with html it's easy.  If you're not it's still reasonably easy.  Either way it's worth leaving formatting for other people to do later until you have had a bit of practice at just getting plain text added a few times.    4.  There are pages that show what changes have been made recently throughout the wiki so if you make some stupid dumb mistake someone else can probably fix it.  Don't worry about making dumb mistakes everyone makes them especially while learning and most people are just happy to see someone new joining in and may even help with a couple of quick hints&amp;tips.   Good luck, have fun and don't worry!  Just add stuff and see how it goes :) Regards from Tom :)   -"

Although I don't consider Wikipedia a definitive source, it's always nice when it agrees with me. ;-)  I note this sentence in the Wikipedia article you cited: 'The correct way to write it in English is \"how-to\", but it is common practice to write it as \"HOWTO\" in the Linux community.' That explains to me why many people on this project are used to the all-caps version. However, the majority of LO's users are Windows users and, therefore, I assume most the readers of our documentation are Windows users; they are less likely to be familiar with Linux conventions.  Unfortunately, no style guide citation is given for the statement 'The correct way to write it in English is \"how-to\",' and I've been unable to find anything about this in a quick look through my style guides. Another possibility is to use \"how-to\" as an adjective, not a noun: for example, \"a how-to guide\" instead of \"a how-to\" or \"a list of how-to guides\" instead of \"a list of how-tos\".  --Jean  On Sun, Nov 6, 2011 at 06:36, Dennis E.

I never saw HOWTO until I was looking up something on a Linux CD one time.  I had seen man pages for years before, of course.  Enough speculation!  Your mention of \"style guide\" reminded me that there is a Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications, though I don't know if it has been kept up.  I had to look at three wrong choices before I found it in my disorganized bookshelves.  It actually has \"how-to\" in the index.  Here is the Entry:     \"how-to vs. how to     \"   Hyphenate as an adjective (as in         'how-to books'), but use two words         as an adverb plus infinitive (as         in 'This is how to format your disk').     \"   In headings and titles, do not         capitalize the 't', as in 'How-tos,         Tips, and Tricks' or 'How to Format         Your Disk.' \"  Notice that they don't address nouning, but they use \"How-tos\".  (The so-called computer dictionary is worse.  Fortunately or unfortunately, the dictionary has no entries with title in the how* range.  Clearly Bill Gates did not proof-read any of this or some serious howlers would have been eliminated.  Bill is very astute concerning language and clarity.)  Citation:    Microsoft Corporation.  Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications, 2nd edition. Microsoft Press (Redmond WA: 1998).  ISBN 1-57231-890-2 pbk with CD-ROM.  Experimentation:  I thought I might try searching the CD-ROM version of the document. There is a Microsoft .chm version, but it's search treats \"how-to\" as two separate words.  Bummer. Ahah, they talk about \"readme files\" not \"read-me files\" but that is probably a typographical issue, since the name of the file is being referenced.  I suspect that is the ONLY case where \"howto\" is usable, as well as fully capitalized, when it is about files having a particular name or the application that coughs up such files (the howto command).  Laughs:  I tried running the install of the book on the CD-ROM using Windows 7 64-bit :).  The installer said it needed to install IE 4.0 in order to operate.  I declined.  It looked so 1990s too.

Btw you can look at the thread in Nabble to see how your post got treated.  It didn't get split up.  At least i don't think it did! Regards from Tom :)  "

Most important is to use a neutral (primarily silver, grey or similar) theme with high contrast (such as the so-called \"XP-Silver\" theme one of our team put together for Ubuntu several years ago) and the Galaxy icon set. See here for a bit more info: http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Production#Sample_screenshots  Recently we had a discussion about whether the \"XP-Silver\" theme would install on Ubuntu 11.10 (and how to do it). I don't recall what the outcome was. IMO the Radiance and Adwaita themes on Ubuntu 11.10 are okay, though not quite as good as the old \"XP-Silver\".  I intend to update Chapter 2, Producing LibreOffice UserGuides, of the Contributors Guide with this information if we get it resolved and I ever find time.

Although some months ago my own feelings were that the LibO English docs team didn't really need a specific team leader, my opinion has somewhat evolved since then.  This is partly because of the small number (or even practical non-existence) of regularly active team members. New people have turned up, done some work and then become inactive again. People previously involved in OOo and ODFAuthors have sometime put in some work and then gone silent again - sometimes leaving their work in a half-finished state.  There are only a couple or so people with any accurate idea of the state of play of docs work and who's doing what, and Jean is one of them. Also, I have noticed how there is more general activity from other people when Jean herself is in an active period, and how things go largely dead when she's busy with other stuff in life.  So I do think it would be worth properly naming her team lead, because she does seem to carry a lot of weight with people and since it could give her a better position to be an ambassador for LibO documentation (for recruiting new members, for possibly finding alternative ways of getting documentation written for the project, etc.).  I'd see her as having more of an organizational/coordinating/project management role, and as being more of a \"librarian\" than anything else.  \"Possibly finding alternative ways of getting documentation written for the project\"?  Well, how about the possibility of getting commercial technical documentation and translation agencies involved in sponsoring/undertaking projects, in exchange for some form of publicity/creditation for their contribs? That would, of course, require some serious liaison and organization, and Jean would be a well-qualified candidate for the job (if she felt able to take on the role).  This is just one idea that comes to mind, but I'm starting to think that it's time to do some lateral thinking. The LibreOffice documentation effort has currently ground almost to a halt in terms of real productive work.  "

Further thought: If we don't yet have a wiki page where someone (not necessarily you) lists these issues as they come in (so we can track them), then we should set one up. People can then see what's needed and put their name down to work on it. Forwarding initial contact to list is important, but a tracking page on wiki is also needed.  My main questions are to do with how and where we write/edit help:  * In the Help files themselves? (If so, where?)  * By attaching a file (what format?) to the issue, so someone else can incorporate it in the help?  And what to do if someone on the Docs team finds Help that needs copyediting, enhancement, etc? Open an issue about it, attaching an edited/revised version? Edit the Help file directly?  Depending on the length and detail of the answer, this might become part of an existing chapter of the Contributors Guide, or it could be a chapter on its own. IMO it's very important to distinguish between how to work on the Help vs how to work on the user guides.  --Jean  "

There has been a project for a wiki-based help in the pipeline for a few months but, for the moment, the work still involves checking out the codebase from Git and editing files within it.   Hmmmmm, well, to obtain the content to edit, someone would have to procure it from Git. It would probably be simpler if a person wanting to work on the help files were to work on their own local copy.   I think the idea would be that someone working on one of the bug reports would come and discuss the resolution of the problem here on the ML with the rest of the team, or at least come and ask questions here when in doubt.   i think you're right that there should be a dedicated chapter on the subject, and that it's important to teach newcomers the distinction between documentation and the software's built-in help.  I'll take this on as a task to do along with revising the Alfresco content of the contributor docs.  Perhaps both subjects would merit writing-up on the wiki, too, but we should perhaps be careful about duplicating coverage because of the probable future emergence of conflicts in the info.

Hmm, well \"Export to Pdf\" doesn't but \"Print\" - \"to file\" does.  On Windows, right now, there is a problem with any software that deals with embedded fonts as there is an exploit that a carefully prepared ttf font can used to errr exploit.  Their method of dealing with the problem is to block parts of the programs that can handle embedded fonts.  So, it's better to get your own fonts for your own systems.    LibreOffice is immune as it doesn't embed fonts and Gnu&amp;Linux is immune because it doesn't use the same fonts parser.    Hopefully the whole problem might be sorted out in a couple of weeks.

They are in the git repository in hc2 (helpcontent2), which one would have to check out and use one's own local git tree. Once changes had been made, one could propose integration of patches, as diff or patch files, either attached to the issue or sent to dev mailing list.  If there are any questions about creating new help content, probably the best person to ask is Andras Timar. From what I understand, new entries require creation of a unique node id, so that the help index can be rebuilt properly at compile time.  My understanding was that at one time it was going to be possible to just write a new wiki entry in the online wiki help, which would get converted back into the source code help via some script magic, but I don't know what became of that. Andras is likely to know more.   Alex    "

I think the logical place would be just before \"Deleting Sheets\" on page 17; that is, after the section titled \"Inserting new sheets\". And yes, you'll need to write some text to go with it (unless the Calc Guide includes something you can reuse).   OK.   Just a few words, and see below about combining with other info into a section on data analysis.   That's good. You might say a little bit more than you've got in the draft. Maybe you can get some ideas or words from the first paragraph of Calc Guide Chapter 8? Also, mention that in LO 3.3 this feature is called DataPilot.  After further reflection, I think perhaps a short section on data analysis, mentioning some of the methods Calc provides (with pivot tables as an important method), would be more useful in this chapter than just an item on PTs. The introductory section of Calc Guide Chapter 9 has some good ideas, and you can also mention consolidating data, subtotals, scenarios, other \"what if\" tools, goal seek, and solver. Just a few words on each.  Let's tie together the basic data entry info earlier in this Getting Started chapter and offer to readers the idea that they can go further. Hmmm, I see the CG has subtotals in Chapter 9.  BTW, references to other books are to chapters only (sometimes section headings), but never page numbers.  Section titles should start with an \"-ing\" word, for consistency with the rest of the chapter and book. So, for example, \"Using pivot tables\" (capitalization not necessary).   Together in one section, yes. Page 35 is good. A bit more discussion, please. First two paragraphs of Calc Guide Ch7, slightly modified, could be useful.    Other things to do (as listed near the top of this section, https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development#Getting_Started_Guide )  1) Use the Template Changer extension to apply the v3.4 chapter template (LO_3_4_chapter_template.ott, available from the Documentation > Resources folder in Alfresco). [You may need to download and install the extension, then download and import the template into LO. Get it from http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/template-changer and put it anywhere on your computer, then follow instructions in http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/HowTo/install_extension ] You may also wish to review the relevant part of the GS chapter on styles and templates for how to use this extension.  2) Change arrows in menu paths to > (to match most other books).  3) Ensure that feedback address on Copyright page shows documentation@global.libreoffice.org (global is missing in some chapters).  4) Check screenshots for changes. Some are definitely out of date, but I don't know which ones. Use silver/gray theme for any replacements needed. In many cases (Chapter 4,5,6,7) the component guide will contain a newer image that can be used in this book without necessity of recapturing/redoing.  --Jean  "

However, I have found what I consider an acceptable replacement theme, a combination of an GTK+ theme called \"Adwaita\" (shipped with Ubuntu 11.10) and a Window theme called Evolve, which must be downloaded and installed. Note that using the Evolve GTK+ theme does not give the desired result (the contrast is not good enough).  I have written this up here, along with a screenshot and instructions on downloading and installing Evolve:  https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Production#Sample_screenshots  This should also work on other distros (though the method of installation will vary). For Ubuntu 11.10, use the Gnome Tweak Tool (info about that is on the wiki page too).  Comments welcome.

It divides people into four groups: those who don't understand a situation at all; those who like the idea until something happens that they don't like; those who begin work on something but let other things get in their way to prevent completion; and those who actually accomplish something some more than others and some less. Such is the case with volunteers.     People want someone to lead (read that do things for them) but seldom step up to doing things themselves as much as they should. Here is another religious reference. When Israel first neared their destination, they refused to go any further because of what 10 men had said. Talking about not following someone, the entire army (603550 men) with the exception of 2 men prepared to return to Egypt.     I'm still amazed that a wiki page has been created in which we were suppose to discuss job descriptions for the team and only two have entered anything there. I posted my thoughts, and another person added my name at the beginning of my post. That has been it. Again, I have seen several +1 with no -1 in posts. But where are their thoughts on this wiki page? Who has said that they will take responsibility for a specific area of documentation?      We are a group of individuals with talents. What is it that each one can do well? What are our areas of expertise? Who can we rely upon for help when we need it? One wiki page has a list of names, but nothing about these people as far what they can provide the the team. What is our commitment to the team?      The main goal for what the team should be accomplishing has already been stated. But how well has the main goal been broken down into smaller goals that apply to the documents for each of the components of LO?      Another wiki page diagrams the path a new document should take before it is published. So, who is going to take on the responsibility of revise a chapter or creating a new one? Who is going to review the chapters for clarity or correctness? Who is going to proofread them for grammar etc.? Who will make the final decision as to whether it should be published or not?      I have a few more thoughts as well that I will post at a later time concerning what we should tell someone who wants do some technical writing.

When inserting shapes for a drawing in a slide I think that the term \"invisible\" for the fill-in colour should be changed to \"none\". Using the word \"none\" is a standard term for fill-in colours for shapes in computer software. This is the first time I have come across \"invisible\" and did throw off track a little bit.  Users will be expecting to see the term \"none\" when making shapes in drawings. Also, \"none\" will be an easier word to translate.  This comment also applies to the Drawing Guide.

If something relevant crops up on another list it would be nice to have the relevant mail forwarded to here so that we could respond. Likewise if something here is relevant to one of the other lists you are subscribed to it would be nice to know that the mail gets forwarded to them.   I cover the Users, Marketing, Steering (has just changed name) and Accessibility. Users is very high traffic but Accessibility is very low. Still it is difficult to cover so many lists. Two or 3 lists each might be good for the ones i don't cover. Lets say 2 lists each, ie Docs&amp;Web or Docs&amp;Design.   The Vietnamese chap that was here last week made some interesting points and i think it would be good if there were liaison officers covering the various translation teams.  Still i think it is impractical to cover more than 2 or perhaps 3 lists. I never get time to really do anything useful or hands-on and i am going to have to drop a couple of the lists i do follow in about a month.   Having some overlap is good. I have seen David making some valuable posts in the Steering Lists in support of the Docs Team, sometimes in support of me or sometimes presenting an alternate view that i might not have thought of. I have a feeling that he is also on the Web List which i am not.   Would it be good to have something on an appropriate wiki-page so that we can keep a rough track of which lists are covered?

It's kinda 2 steps backwards and then the backwards systems will need to grow and deal with the issues that the current system already deals with At the same time the backwards system will have to worry about being backwards compatible as it tries to stumble forwards.

There are also comments on the side. Which style is best for the text? I chose OOoTextBody because the image had been messing up the appearance of the screen.  I am unclear where to put the section on data analysis. I put it on page 36. What should I use as a model for formatting the individual items?  I borrowed and edited text from the Guide for the text about formulas and functions.  I went to: http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/template-changer  and downloaded the template changer without a problem;   However, at:  https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/howto/install_extension  It said: \"There is currently no text in this page.\"  So, nothing was done with the template.  I did a search for \"->\" to replace with only \">\", but found none.  \"Global\" was added to the email address.  Screenshots:  Figures 1-5 show slight differences between compared with version 3.4. Is this worth changing? The boxes and arrows are ingrained in the images.  Figure 6: Version 3.4's box is gray, but the content is exactly the same.  Figure 8: Same question as #6.  In fact, as I have been looking at the screenshots, the only issue seems to be gray versus the blue of version 3.4.  Thanks, and I hope I did not miss something obvious!  David    ________________________________  From: Jean Weber  To: documentation@global.libreoffice.org  Sent: Tuesday, November 8, 2011 11:04 PM Subject: Re: [libreoffice-documentation] My work on the Getting Started Guide;  I have questions   Comments interleaved below. See also end of note for other things that need to be done.   I think the logical place would be just before \"Deleting Sheets\" on page 17; that is, after the section titled \"Inserting new sheets\". And yes, you'll need to write some text to go with it (unless the Calc Guide includes something you can reuse).   OK.   Just a few words, and see below about combining with other info into a section on data analysis.   That's good. You might say a little bit more than you've got in the draft. Maybe you can get some ideas or words from the first paragraph of Calc Guide Chapter 8? Also, mention that in LO 3.3 this feature is called DataPilot.  After further reflection, I think perhaps a short section on data analysis, mentioning some of the methods Calc provides (with pivot tables as an important method), would be more useful in this chapter than just an item on PTs. The introductory section of Calc Guide Chapter 9 has some good ideas, and you can also mention consolidating data, subtotals, scenarios, other \"what if\" tools, goal seek, and solver. Just a few words on each.  Let's tie together the basic data entry info earlier in this Getting Started chapter and offer to readers the idea that they can go further. Hmmm, I see the CG has subtotals in Chapter 9.  BTW, references to other books are to chapters only (sometimes section headings), but never page numbers.  Section titles should start with an \"-ing\" word, for consistency with the rest of the chapter and book. So, for example, \"Using pivot tables\" (capitalization not necessary).   Together in one section, yes. Page 35 is good. A bit more discussion, please. First two paragraphs of Calc Guide Ch7, slightly modified, could be useful.    Other things to do (as listed near the top of this section, https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/Development#Getting_Started_Guide )  1) Use the Template Changer extension to apply the v3.4 chapter template (LO_3_4_chapter_template.ott, available from the Documentation > Resources folder in Alfresco). [You may need to download and install the extension, then download and import the template into LO. Get it from http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/template-changer and put it anywhere on your computer, then follow instructions in http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/HowTo/install_extension ] You may also wish to review the relevant part of the GS chapter on styles and templates for how to use this extension.  2) Change arrows in menu paths to > (to match most other books).  3) Ensure that feedback address on Copyright page shows documentation@global.libreoffice.org (global is missing in some chapters).  4) Check screenshots for changes. Some are definitely out of date, but I don't know which ones. Use silver/gray theme for any replacements needed. In many cases (Chapter 4,5,6,7) the component guide will contain a newer image that can be used in this book without necessity of recapturing/redoing.  --Jean  "

The items needing replacement are actual arrows, and you should see them in all the menu paths given in the chapter.

        "text": "     I have been known to be verbose at times, but here are my thought about Step 1 of the Workflow list:  1.) The workflow begins with creating a new document or revising and      existing document.     a.) Create a new document using the latest chapter template          (currently LO_3_4_chapter_template.ott). Also study and apply          the principles of Producing-LO-userguides.odt. Both of these          documents will guide you as you write your new document.         i.) Naming convention for new documents: CCDDDBB-Name where CC              is the book initials, DD is the LibreOffice version (33 is              version 3.3 and 34 is version 3.4), and BB is the chapter              number (two digits). For directions on formating the name               of the document, see page 20 of Producing-LO-              userguides.odt. For example, WG33-WorkingWithText.odt is              chapter 3 of the Writer Guide for LibreOffice version 3.3.x.                Book initials (CC):                    GS = Getting Started                     WG = Writer Guide                     CG = Calc Guide                     DG = Draw Guide                     IG = Impress Guide                     BG = Base Guide                     MG = Math Guide     b.) Existing documents already have a template. When editing one,           you might need to update the template (first thing to check).          Then make sure you have \"change tracking\" on (Edit > Changes >          Record). Then review the document making changes as you go.     c.) Uploading drafts to the appropriate draft folder:          i.)   If you have not already done so, request your user name                and password for the Alfresco web site from the document                team mailing list. (documentation@global.libreoffice.org)          ii.)  Then sign into the Alfresco web site. The path to the                draft folder to which you should upload your draft:                Repository (at the top) > English (left side) >                Documentation > (appropriate folder for your document) >                Drafts.         iii.) Click the Upload button (at the top) and a pop-up window                appears. Click the icon containing a sheet of paper and a                magnifying glass to browse to your draft file on you                computer. Click the Upload file(s) button to begin the                uploading. (uploading process is shown over the name of                your file.) When the uploading is completed, the \"Upload                file(s)\" button changes to OK. Click it. If the uploading                fails, try again. (Some times it takes two or three tries                to successfully upload a file.) The file now appears in                the draft folder.         iv.)  Submitting your document for review: On the right side of                the file look for +More Click it to open a drop down                list. Select \"Submit for review\". (The file is moved to                the Proofing folder.)         v.)   Report what you have done to the document team mailing                 list. (documentation@global.libreoffice.org)      Perhaps this is too exact, and perhaps someone else can find a way to say these things if fewer words.  --Dan   "

David Michel dsmichel@yahoo.com wrote,> p18  Some comments: 1) We do not use the term \"radio button\". Often the term \"option\" is a good choice, but in this case I would use \"action\" because the heading above the two radio buttons is \"Action\".  2) With rare exceptions, we do not use the phrase \"allows you to\". In this case a better wording would be \"Select the Move action to...\" In other situations the phrase \"Use the xxxx option to...\" might work best. The general principle is: use imperative voice (for example, \"Choose xxxx to do x\") or an infinitive phrase such as \"To do x, choose xxxx.\"  3) Although the two sentences you flagged are a bit redundant, in introductory material like this we've found that it's often best to make statements that might seem obvious to us.  4) I am sure there are other ways to move sheets, at least in some circumstances, not just using this dialog. For example, you can click-and-drag a sheet tab. This section should mention those other methods. (You may need to play around a bit to figure out what they are.)  5) The first paragraph on page 17 under the heading needs to be amended.  6) Formatting tips: Do not insert blank paragraphs by pressing Enter. Do not use two spaces after a full stop (period); use only one. Do not leave blank spaces at the end of a paragraph. If you turn on end-of-paragraph markers, you'll be able to see blank paras and spaces at the ends of paras easily.  7) Do not put quotation marks around the names of options, buttons, list boxes, or any other part of a dialog. Instead, use the OOoMenuPath character style or (in some cases) the OOoEmphasis character style, or (in some cases, such as the name of the dialog) no special style. The style descriptions in the template instructions should give a good idea of what style to use when. Unfortunately, many of the chapters do not use the agreed-upon styles, so following the examples of use in a chapter may lead you astray.   I think that's good. However, \"Analyzing data\" is a better title than \"Using data analysis\". BTW, you have used \"TextBody\" instead of \"OOoTextBody\" as the para style in that section.   You could use either bullet points or a definition list (choosing the appropriate para styles). In this case, I think a definition list would be good.   OK.   You changed the visible address, but you failed to change the hyperlink. (A common mistake.)   The only difference I can see is an icon in Fig1 and an icon in Fig 5, though I could be missing something. I may have the original .ODG files from which these PNG images were created, or a bit of fiddling in GIMP will fix the icons quickly. (I do this a lot, to avoid recapturing and relabeling.)  Whether items are gray or white usually depends on the operating system and the desktop theme in use. The blue is NOT related to the version of LibreOffice, but to your o/s.  BTW, the Figure 15 that you added appears to have been taken on Windows XP. Please change the Windows desktop from the Blue theme to the Silver theme, so any images you take will more closely match others in the book. It's in Settings > Control Panel > Display > Appearance tab; near the bottom is \"Color scheme\": choose Silver.  Although the above list of corrections may seem formidable, what you have done is fairly typical for new contributors who haven't got used to our writing and formatting style yet. I'll hand it back to you now for another try.  --Jean    "

The good news is that the ePub is not nearly as bad as I expected from my own trial conversions of OOo books over a year ago; the text is readable and the figures are in place and sized reasonably.  There is a lot of bad news, however. First, the layout has suffered. For example, the Tip/Note/Caution tables look both wrong and silly (a box with the Tip/Note/Caution words as a sort of heading, then a big gap, and then the text). Another example: The bullets and numbers on lists are offset into what would be the left-hand margin, but there really isn't a margin on the left, so they fall off the edge of the \"page\". At some magnifications, two \"columns\" or \"pages\" appear side-by-side, so numbers and bullets on lists in the right-hand column are visible. There are other conspicuous problems as well. Most or all can probably be solved by making some changes in our styles and template, if we decide that's worth doing at some point in the future "

Tom's been doing some reorganisation of the docs wiki, and I do a bit now and then, but it needs a lot of work. You can help by identifying things that are missing or unclear so someone can fix them. Often the \"missing\" items are on another page but not referenced in places where people might look for them.

A small number of full system admins are supposed to help out with content admin jobs not available to the English contributors group.  This is something that can be changed, of course.

What we do have is a clearly unanimous decision taken by the people who are best informed about the nitty-gritty and background of this issue.   We do not need to create extra work for people that may be fairly clueless about this area or who have expressed disinterest by not joining the group.

Your understanding or interpretation of the word \"published\" as I appear to understand it seems to equate more to \"documentation team approved release\".  For example, the public can already access and download Base related documentation here :  http://media.libreoffice.org/cmis/browser/English/Documentation/Base%20Guide/Draft  The licenses of these documents, unless stated otherwise therein, are CC-BY-SA, in order to be in agreement with the terms of use of the TDF infrastructure.  Note that I'm not against the approach, merely pointing out what I see as a flaw in the reasoning based on the underlying tenets of copyright law.  If the documentation project really wanted to keep this as \"unpublished\" (i.e. not made available to the public), then it would have to hide access to the drafts and proofed stages of the site under the media.libreoffice.org address, and have some kind of binding agreement for the contributors of the documentation agreement that would oblige them to recognise a work as being made available only when it attained the status \"published\". As you will probably appreciate, this would probably attract a fair deal of criticism, possibly be fairly complex to set in motion, and would probably deter many from participating (who would want to sign up to something like that, especially for something they do mainly in their spare time?)

If a contributor wishes to have his/her contribution accepted within the LibreOffice project then they have to do so under the LGLP3+/MPL+ for code, or CC-BY-SA for anything else, unless there are other specific reasons for this not being the case (which will always raise the question as to whether it is really accepted or not), as for example, with some older code that has been revamped but must be kept currently under LGPL2.  So TDF (or even the German foundation currently running things while it is being set up) is not the owner of the documentation produced.  The Documentation Project is not a legal entity in the sense of the word \"organisation\" referred to in the AL2 license - it has no legal remit of representation for copyright assignments.    Indeed, I'm not (to my knowledge) employed by any entity involved in this project (thankfully), which allows me to be have an unfettered opinion. I have been known as an \"lectron libre\" in the past, and for the most part, have managed to stay that way ;-)  I have already stated on the Apache OOo list that I would not allow for the licences of any of my previous documentation contributions to be changed (since at one stage, some people were touting an \"automatic, by default change\" - fortunately, the Apache mentors of the project are crucially aware of doing this correctly when it comes to the legal issues). What the final result will be remains to be seen - I fear a severely trimmed OOo, but I am also assuming that the AOOo project will in due course fill those gaps.  Of course, my position with regard to AL2 is my own, and each person in this documentation project must decide in their own hearts/minds, how they wish to act. I am not here to sway them in one way or another on that decision. I merely wanted to point out the oversimplification that Jean made with regard to the word \"published\". This oversimplification could lead people to make a decision with regard to the licensing of their works, without understanding all of the ramifications behind it.

The ASF is very attuned to treating such material both respectfully and appropriately with respect to conditions of the licenses that have been offered.    Furthermore, *even* if the license is compatible for inclusion in an ALv2-licensed project, it is a policy of the ASF to never include in its projects material that the license-granter does not want a project to have, even if the license allows it otherwise.

There  are exclusive rights that obtain to copyright holders.  A copyright holder can  license some or all of those rights without surrendering the copyright itself.  Absent such a license, exercise of an exclusive right by anyone but the  copyright owner constitutes infringement.  Some infringements are defensible  as \"fair use\" in some jurisdictions, but only judges decide whether the  defense succeeds.  In the example given by Tom below, (re-)distribution of the documents by TDF  is done under the CC-BY-SA and it is not a relicensing.  It is done under the  original license.  And communication of the same license to the recipients is  done under the original license.  Were the TDF or its contributors to make a  derivative work, the CC-BY-SA requires that derivative to satisfy the  Share-Alike requirement.  (It is a form of copyleft.)  Any added copyright  would apply to the new material and its combination with the original.  But  the original copyright is intact: You can't copyright the parts of a work that  are not your own independent creation (unless you've been transferred that  copyright).  Finally, note that the copyright holder still holds all of the original  exclusive rights and is not restricted by the license granted others.  That is  how Sun, which held the copyrights to OpenOffice.org, was able to  privately-license the code base under different terms than the LGPL that was  granted to the general public and used on the open-source OpenOffice.org  distributions.  One feature of reciprocal licenses that I favor is the fact  that the recipients have all of the same rights that the copyright owner has,  apart from the ability to transfer the copyright itself.   - Dennis  -----Original Message---"

For example, the author of a NEW document (not part of a user guide) about LibreOffice could choose to delete the Apache license.   In fact, AFAIK there is no requirement for such docs to be based on the user guide template  The template's main value is in providing a consistent look-and-feel (styles, colours, layout) and its use is therefore encouraged for all LO docs long enough to need pages for title, copyright, ToC. The template also provides a convenient boilerplate of text for the copyright page. But that page can be modified to fit the requirements of docs that are not part of the user guide set.  Of course that brings up the question of what is a user guide versus some other document. Are stand-alone docs also \"user guides\"? In one sense, yes, anything written to support or guide users could be considered a user guide; but I don't use that term to describe standalone docs written by individuals and contributed to the project.

If someone who did not hold the copyright made a derivative work of those documents to rebrand them for Apache OpenOffice, change screen shots, etc., they would need to honor the original license.  (If it is dual licensed the creator of the derivative has a choice which license(s) to produce the derivative under.)  If someone who held the copyright on the New documents were to make the derivative, they could certainly offer a different (dual) license.  By either route, even if one of the available licenses were an Apache ALv2 license, it still would not constitute a contribution to the Apache OpenOffice project.  Contribution is a separate act.  Now, to have it also be contributed to an Apache project, there would have to be a contribution agreement (iCLA).  Whether that is done or not is a separate decision. An Apache project, or any other project for which the ALv2 license is compatible could also rely on the new document as a 3rd party work.  In the case of an Apache project, this would not happen if the licensor objected.     A final example: If I wrote a new document that applied to LO and licensed it in a way that TDF accepts, I could also rebrand and modify it myself and offer a different license on that version.  I am in a position to go farther and contribute the rebranded one to the Apache OpenOffice project too.  That involves more steps, even though I have already registered an iCLA with ASF.

Also, where I say below that an iCLA is required if a contribution to an Apache project is to be made, there are other ways.  A work could be contributed under an SGA (Software Grant Agreement, I think.)  The SGA provides a permissive license to Apache that allows the work to be licensed as an Apache project result.  It has to be done by someone entitled to do so. (That is what Oracle did in licensing OpenOffice.org to the ASF.  Oracle still holds the copyright though and other licenses of the same content are not revocable.  That's why the Oracle grant does not interfere with TDF continuing with LO as a derivative of the LGPLd OO.o software.

But I suspect that most contributors don't and won't care, and of those who do care, most will be happy with the dual license. Indeed, I suspect that most contributors to the docs produced by ODFAuthors and the docs being created here at LO have never paid any attention to the licensing of those docs.  I'll reiterate my comment in another note that if someone (you, for example) were to write a new document from scratch and wanted to license it only under CC-BY-SA, then they can certainly do so.  --Jean  "

As i understand it the objection was something to do with individuals having to sign an agreement with Apache but Dennis said that would not be required.  I am a little hazy about that tho!    I think that if employees of a 3rd party company have been ordered to work on LibreOffice then it's likely that the company has accepted that works produced by them are not the property of the 3rd party company.  The company's i can think of that are likely to let (or order) employees to work on LO are ones such as Novel, RedHat, Canonical, Google or perhaps governments such as the Spanish ones all of whom are quite familiar with and welcoming of the idea of employees doing work for other companies because it gives them a better end-product when combined with their own stuff.  I'm never sure about what is going on in Brasil but again it seems to be positive about this sort of thing.  Companies that are really strict about claiming their employees work as their own are unlikely to be contributing workers time to this project in the first place.  I gather there are some companies that impose restrictions on what employees do with their free-time especially if using company equipment.  I think employees of such companies are likely to already be aware of the likelihood of those sorts of restrictions.    So, i think all objections to dual-licensing have been eliminated but i'm still not completely certain of that.  The pedantry and legalese in this thread is difficult to understand but from what i can gather i think dual-licensing of new documentation is possible without any individuals signing CLA agreements?

Although I am a member of TDF Board of Directors and a TDF spokesperson, at the moment I am speaking as an independent individual working for the project in the marketing environment.  First, I will express my ideas.  In addition to being a professional marketer, I am a journalist and a book author. I have studied the legal aspects of documents - and related licenses - before deciding to use CC BY-NC-SA for all my licensed documents (mostly presentations).  I think it should be clear that GPL, LGPL, AL and MPL are software licenses, which have been stretched in their scope to include documents because someone - definitely not a lawyer - has thought they were appropriate. I am not familiar with the law of every country, but these licenses are not compatible - at all - with the Italian law (Codice Civile).  On the contrary, Creative Commons has been developed by Lawrence Lessig in order to protect copyright in Internet times, because Codice Civile and similar laws were not contemplating the free distribution and the reuse of contents. CC is a specific license for documents, and as such should be the only one used for documents. Using a software license does not simply make sense, and should be avoided. CC has been studied to be compatible with Codice Civile and similar laws.  In addition, The Document Foundation is definitely supporting copyleft software licenses, and actively discouraging the use of so called \"permissive\" licenses - which I personally prefer to define as \"predatory\", because they steal from the community to give to the rich and wealthy (to make it easy, the opposite of Robin Hood) - such as the Apache License.  Although we have not discussed the subject at BoD level, I can anticipate that the foreseeable result of a discussion would be against using Apache License for documents. I would personally discard a document licensed under AL, as I discard every document licensed with a software license (because they are the result of a nonsensical choice).  Of course, each individual is free to choose how to license his work, but I would really prefer to default to CC and add AL - or any other software license - only if the individual has a strong motivation to do so. Defaulting to CC/AL, in my opinion, means to \"legally\" steal the work of all people who are not enough knowledgeable about software licenses (in my opinion, the majority of people involved in documentation).  Second, I will ask questions.  Are we speaking about LibreOffice user guides? In this case, I do think that it does not even make sense to use Apache License, because LibreOffice is moving forward from that code base while AOOoI is moving backwards from the same code base thanks to the insanity of IP sanitization, and the two programs will differ in a substancial way.  Are we thinking to change the template without explaining to individuals the consequences - for their intellectual property - of the license change/addition? I would personally find this EXTREMELY unfair, and I would personally veto the license change without a clear and visible explanation of the consequences for their work of AL adoption for documents.  ---"

I recommend you join the users support list and/or the forum (see links below) and read the questions and answers. From this you will get an idea of the questions users ask. Do you know the answers? If not, go through the user guides and help and try to find the answers. This exercise will help you become (more) familiar with both the program and the existing documentation.  You will find that many questions are very basic and are easily answered by the regulars on the list or forum. But some questions are not so easily answered. Often that is because the person asking the question does know how to explain their problem very well, but sometimes it's because the question is complex or is related to the use of more complex parts of LibreOffice. Sometimes the \"real\" question is clear if you are familiar with what the user is trying to do or if you recognise they are using Microsoft terminology and LibreOffice's terms are different; the user may in fact be asking the wrong question to get the answer they need.  I encourage you to answer the more difficult questions on the list or forum, but only if you actually know the answer. (In the past I've seen many people attempt to be helpful but give a wrong answer "

        "text": "Thank you Jean. I have already subscribed to both the forum and user list as you suggested.  Yet, in my experience training customer service reps, I'd like to add some more advice that may come in useful before answering user's questions. Answering difficult questions is indeed a great practice. However, considering that users may ask the wrong questions (or the right questions in the wrong words), we have to make sure we master the key concepts before attempting to answer them. Otherwise, we may get confused ourselves and end up messing up our ideas or even the docs we are working on.  What I suggest is to follow a systematic approach:  1). Decide which your area of expertise will be. LibreOffice is a broad project, and mastering it all may be too much to do it all at once. For example, I never use LO Math because I don't need it but mainly because my knowledge of mathematics is too limited. Instead, I use Calc on a daily basis, so I decided to master that application first.  2). Make acquainted with the application of your choice. Read the existing user guides. Make yourself familiar with the terminoly and concepts.  Try the application yourself. This will help you understand it better. Before being ready to answer other people questions, we must be able to answer our own questions. Don't be afraid of asking. Remember that every good teacher has started as a good student.  3). Help other users. Once we feel confident enough to use the application ourselves, we can start helping others. I usually use the following strategy when dealing with customers:  - Read the question between the lines. What is important is not what the user is asking, but what the user is really trying to do. Remember that they are not specialists and sometimes don't know how to ask for help and end up putting forth general question such as \"I cannot use a formula in Calc\". Therefore, before attempting to solve a problem, we must guide the user to provide the right info. How can we do it? Simple, ask them more questions. Help the user narrow the question until we know exactly what the problem is.  - Once we pinpoint the problem we can start looking for the answer. If we are familiar with the application, we may possibly know the answer. If not, we will know where to look.  - When we have the answer, put it forth in a clear and consice way.  Hope you find it useful. Regards  Gabriel   "

I think it's a LOT easier to avoid the issue now than to deal with paying legal experts time, adding extra days in courts, perhaps paying damages afterwards. It's not likely to be the main thrust of an MS suit against us but it might be an extra card they play in court timed to gain tactical advantage by distracting our defence from the main fight.   MS Office is a major percentage of MS profits. To think that MS wont come after us at some point seems very naive unless LO remains a tiny percentage of the market. Under TDF LO has grown significantly faster than during any equivalent time-frame under Sun.   I don't see the point in risking it when we really don't need to. There are a tiny percentage of pix that are significantly different in Windows so it makes sense to minimise our risks to that tiny percentage. Also, why promote MS in the guides?

In fact, all of the replacement pix that show icons are using the wrong set. 3) All blank paragraphs should be removed. Most of them appear to be after new figures. Paragraphs with figures must be in OOoFigure style, not OOoTextBody style. 4) Unsaved changes icon (status bar) has changed. 5) Please replace the little arrows in menu paths with >, making sure that the character style for the > and the space before and after it is OOoMenuPath. 6) One trick I use for getting rid of the OOo logo in the upper left of pix that are otherwise okay is to open the pic in Gimp and fiddle it there--instead of recapturing all the pix. Since many of the pix in the earlier chapter are of a higher quality, that might improve the result. Of course, some pix are wrong in other ways, so that trick might not work. 7) Please set LO to use its own Save and Open dialogs. I think you've used a Ubuntu Save dialog in Figure 16. 8) Be sure that no paragraphs are of style \"Default\". 9) In procedural lists, sentences should end with a period (full stop), unless a colon is needed to introduce a nest list. 10) Sheets can be moved in another way (by dragging) in addition to the new way that you have correctly described.

I'm now fairly sure that others have reported the problem, but I didn't realise what they were talking about.  In penance, I have worked out how to solve this problem and get us all able to use the same icon set. It appears to be a simple solution: download LO from the LO website and install and use that when writing documentation.  This is what I did. I have two machines with \"clean\" Ubuntu 11.10 installs on them, which includes LO 3.4.3. Those copies of LO show only the Human icon sets, just as in Gabriel's picture.  I then downloaded and installed LO 3.4.4 from the LO website. When I open that, all the various icon sets are listed in Tools > Options > LO > View, as I described in a previous note.  Repeating: When writing documentation, be sure you install LO from the file available on the LO website. The instructions I've written elsewhere mention this, for other reasons; I hadn't realised (or had forgotten) that the icon sets are yet another reason to NOT use the file provided by a Linux distro when writing docs. It's fine for general use, but it does have a few differences that make it unsuitable for general documentation purposes.  Of course, this means that some Linux users will see different icons; but if we use Ubuntu's icon set, then everyone else is going to see different icons. So we'll do the only reasonable thing, which is to document the official LO version, not Ubuntu's version of LO.  This also reminds me that I need to add some words in each chapter file to advise people that the icons they see may not be what's in the book. I shall do so, and put it in the template.  --Jean  "

Insert a table using table design and then immediately press the delete key. Does not work if de-select the table and the re-select the table. 4. Use insert table and immediately press the delete key. Does not work if de-select the table and the re-select the table.

The new file is:  0105GS34-THIRDDraftGettingStartedWithCalcDavidMichel  Here is an update of what I have done, and I hope I did not overlook something:  I forgot to mention a comment I made on page 8. What do you think?   p.18:  I replaced \"radio button\" with \"action\".   p.18:  I removed the phrase \"allows you to\". I found no other examples of this phrase.   The only method I found was drag and drop, and I wrote something brief.   Do you mean the paragraph under \"Inserting new sheets\"? What do you want me to change?   The OOoTextBody style removed the spaces between the paragraphs. I checked for a single space after the periods on both pages 18 and 36-37.  p.36 I used OOoTextBody for the text, and the Definition styles for the definitions, using the definitions on page 36 as a guide.   I changed the email address.   Figure 15 is now silver.   I copied an arrow, and did a find and replace with a \">\" - but, all it did was give me an arrow and a \">\", and I could not delete the arrow. Also, is there a way of adding a style to this character at once for all of its 96 instances?    I typed in the URL, not from a link. The same error message appears.   I could not continue after step 3. The attached image shows that I did not have the files the instructions show.    ________________________________  From: Jean Weber  To: Documentation@global.libreoffice.org  Sent: Saturday, November 19, 2011 7:33 PM Subject: [libreoffice-documentation] Re: My work on the Getting Started Guide   I've now looked at the file and will respond to the questions I skipped in my last note.  David Michel dsmichel@yahoo.com wrote,> p18  Some comments: 1) We do not use the term \"radio button\". Often the term \"option\" is a good choice, but in this case I would use \"action\" because the heading above the two radio buttons is \"Action\".  2) With rare exceptions, we do not use the phrase \"allows you to\". In this case a better wording would be \"Select the Move action to...\" In other situations the phrase \"Use the xxxx option to...\" might work best. The general principle is: use imperative voice (for example, \"Choose xxxx to do x\") or an infinitive phrase such as \"To do x, choose xxxx.\"  3) Although the two sentences you flagged are a bit redundant, in introductory material like this we've found that it's often best to make statements that might seem obvious to us.  4) I am sure there are other ways to move sheets, at least in some circumstances, not just using this dialog. For example, you can click-and-drag a sheet tab. This section should mention those other methods. (You may need to play around a bit to figure out what they are.)  5) The first paragraph on page 17 under the heading needs to be amended.  6) Formatting tips: Do not insert blank paragraphs by pressing Enter. Do not use two spaces after a full stop (period); use only one. Do not leave blank spaces at the end of a paragraph. If you turn on end-of-paragraph markers, you'll be able to see blank paras and spaces at the ends of paras easily.  7) Do not put quotation marks around the names of options, buttons, list boxes, or any other part of a dialog. Instead, use the OOoMenuPath character style or (in some cases) the OOoEmphasis character style, or (in some cases, such as the name of the dialog) no special style. The style descriptions in the template instructions should give a good idea of what style to use when. Unfortunately, many of the chapters do not use the agreed-upon styles, so following the examples of use in a chapter may lead you astray.   I think that's good. However, \"Analyzing data\" is a better title than \"Using data analysis\". BTW, you have used \"TextBody\" instead of \"OOoTextBody\" as the para style in that section.   You could use either bullet points or a definition list (choosing the appropriate para styles). In this case, I think a definition list would be good.   OK.   You changed the visible address, but you failed to change the hyperlink. (A common mistake.)   The only difference I can see is an icon in Fig1 and an icon in Fig 5, though I could be missing something. I may have the original .ODG files from which these PNG images were created, or a bit of fiddling in GIMP will fix the icons quickly. (I do this a lot, to avoid recapturing and relabeling.)  Whether items are gray or white usually depends on the operating system and the desktop theme in use. The blue is NOT related to the version of LibreOffice, but to your o/s.  BTW, the Figure 15 that you added appears to have been taken on Windows XP. Please change the Windows desktop from the Blue theme to the Silver theme, so any images you take will more closely match others in the book. It's in Settings > Control Panel > Display > Appearance tab; near the bottom is \"Color scheme\": choose Silver.  Although the above list of corrections may seem formidable, what you have done is fairly typical for new contributors who haven't got used to our writing and formatting style yet. I'll hand it back to you now for another try.  --Jean    "

I also produced a clean copy incorporating all the changes and placed it into Proofing so Gabriel or Hazel (or anyone) can have a crack at it.  BTW, when I was playing around with moving and copying sheets, I discovered two things that are not new but were never written up in any earlier version of the Calc Guide, as far as I can tell: (1) As well as moving a sheet within a spreadsheet using drag-and drop, you can also copy a sheet by holding down the Control key while dragging. I added some info about this. (2) The Move/Copy dialog isn't new; it's just been redesigned, and that brought it to my attention on the features list.  Gabriel, when you've done some more chapters of the Calc Guide, you may have some new screenshots to replace the Windows ones. If so, and if those screenshots are also used in this Getting Started chapter, you or David should revisit this chapter and replace the screenshots here.    Good idea. I copied the picture that Gariel had produced for the Calc Guide.   I found at least one instance of \"allows the user to\" and edited it out.   No, I meant the paragraph under the main heading \"Working with sheets\", which now includes copying and moving.   The Definition lists use two styles: \"OOoDefinition Term\" for the bolded first line (a paragraph on its own) of each item, and \"OOoDefinition\" for the following paragraph.   Most of the arrows were replaced as one would expect, though a few were not (I've now fixed them). I don't know why you couldn't delete the arrow in a few instances.   AFAIK, you cannot apply a character style using Find and Replace. One can record a macro to do the job, but otherwise it's a manual operation.   I guess my question wasn't clear.

It is possible to save as an OpenDocument Format template and MS Office 2007 and 2010 claims to be able to read ODFs. Sadly they can only read the older versions. To make LO use the older formats try   Tools - Options - +Load/Save - General  In the middle change the drop-down from \"1.2 Extended (recommended)\" to  \"1.0/1.1\" It might work but it might not. It's still very possible that MS Office might move pictures/logos around a bit and perhaps other things too.   So, the answer really is no imo. Regards from Tom :)   -"

Instead of using Word further, I made DOC subdocuments out of the individual chapters and then offered the author the choice for going to a master document format with either OOo or with FrameMaker instead of an MS Word manuscript.

The fourth is a sample table shown at the top of page 13 of the template and discussed at the bottom of page 12.      When these autotext entries are made, they are written to a .bau file. And I am presently working to create a LO.bau file that will contain all four of these entries. This file can be used on any computer running LO and for any language. (Use the dialog to change the name of the autotext entries.      I am also writing a short chapter on how to use the AutoText dialog in our documents for the Contributor's Guide. This I hope to get done today. It will describe how the uses of the dialog and where to put the LO.bau file on your computer.      What I need is some more some more suggestions at to what should be put into the LO.bau file. Any suggestions as to things you would like to insert into your document with only a few key strokes?      On page 11 of the template, Figure 1 contains a picture at the top with several arrows and a table below the picture. I have created a table within a form for this. Place the graphic in the top row (all the cells of this row are merged for this purpose). The columns in the other rows are formated to hold the numbers and category descriptions and be the proper dimensions. I further refined this by making two autotext entries from this. One has six columns in the table just like Figure 1. The other one has only four columns for graphics with fewer categories.      The last autotext entry in the LO.bau file for now is a simple frame. This entry would have the proper formats applied so that the frame would appear in the proper place. The only adjustment would be with the frame's width.      The first version of the LO.bau file is being uploaded to Alfresco: http://alfresco.libreoffice.org/share/page/repository#filter=path|% 2FEnglish%2FDocumentation%2FResources%2FDraft&amp;page=1. Where should it be placed if you want to try using it? Open the AutoText dialog (Control +F3). Then click the Path button in the lower right of the dialog. The Select Paths dialog opens with two paths listed. The bottom path tells you where to place the file. (You can't use the top path unless you are logged on to your computer using an Administrator account anyway.)  --Dan   "

Alfresco has been upgraded to Alfresco 4. The upgrade is finished, barring some tweaks to the site's theming. The principle reason for doing the upgrade was that file uploads are much more robust in this version of Alfresco, whether single-file uploads or multiple. Alfresco is also running on its own server now (I already mentioned this recently).  Now, theoretically, there should have been no data loss. \"If any of the repo is there, it should all be there\", so to speak.  Please could you give more details about exactly what files appear to have got lost? I will then check the problem out. Please could you also tell me when they were uploaded?  You should be able to upload files with no problem now (much better than before), and all work on the site is now finished (until I get around to those theming tweaks in January).  In any case, I'm very sorry for the inconvenience...  "

Yesterday, 29 Dec, all the documents were there and this was before the upgrade to Alfresco as I still had the old green colour scheme when I logged in.  This morning, 30 Dec, I logged in to Alfresco to upload a new draft version of Chapter 3 and was greeted by the new black colour scheme. I went to the drafts folder to upload this new version and found the drafts folder empty. It should have contained all the draft versions of the chapters for the Impress Guide with the exception of chapter 1 (published) and chapter 2 (being proofed). This drafts folder would have also indicated the locked chapters that I have already downloaded for updating which are chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6.  I have not tried uploading any files because the drafts folder is empty and may upset the version numbering of the chapters.  In my opinion, it seems to me the links to all the files have been broken when the upgrade was carried out.  Hope this helps solving the problem.  Regards  Peter Schofield      "

I've noticed that stuff uploaded/updated before and after Dec 29/Dec 30 *seems* to be intact. Am I correct about that?  During the last minor upgrade (3.2 to 3.4), there was no problem. It is true that this is a more-major upgrade (3.4 to 4.0), but I'm not currently aware of any radical changes in Alfresco that would make an Alfresco upgrade hazardous.

There is a backup of the repo that was taken before the upgrade, and there is a previous backup taken Dec 25.   Mea culpa. I've been frantically busy workwise recently, and found an unplanned timeslot for the upgrade at a time when I figured that Europe/Asia-Pacific would be largely asleep or early in the morning, and went ahead. I was keen to bring the new 4.0.c improvements to the LibO repo because the file uploading is much more robust (I've been extensively testing it in my own work).  After investigating the problem, I'll be working on restoring any lost content.  Please feel free to send me all your files that can be uploaded: if I can rebuild the problematic folders then I think it's maybe better to do that than to simply rollback to an earlier backup.
